## Overview
**Institutions** are the "rules of the game." They are the formal and informal structures that govern political life. Without them, politics is just a street fight.

## Core Idea
The core idea is **stability**. Institutions persist over time, outlasting individual politicians. They constrain power and make behavior predictable.

## Formal Definition
-   **Formal Institutions:** Written rules (Constitution, Laws), Organizations (Congress, Supreme Court).
-   **Informal Institutions:** Unwritten norms (Corruption, Patronage, "The way things are done").

## Intuition
-   **The Building:** The White House is a building.
-   **The Institution:** "The Presidency" is an institution. It has powers and traditions that exist regardless of who is President.

## Examples
-   **Separation of Powers:** Dividing institutions (Legislative, Executive, Judicial) so no one gets too powerful.
-   **The Rule of Law:** The institution that says laws apply to everyone, even the King.
-   **Political Parties:** Institutions that organize voters and candidates.

## Common Misconceptions
-   **Misconception:** Institutions are just buildings.
    -   **Correction:** They are *patterns of behavior*. If everyone ignores the Supreme Court, the institution is dead, even if the building stands.
-   **Misconception:** They are unchangeable.
    -   **Correction:** They evolve (Institutional Decay or Reform), but slowly.

## Related Concepts
-   **[Institutionalism](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/political-science/institutionalism.md):** The theory that institutions matter more than individuals.
-   **[Bureaucracy](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/political-science/bureaucracy.md):** The administrative institution.
-   **[Constitution](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/law/constitutional-law.md):** The supreme institution.

## Applications
-   **Nation Building:** You can't just hold an election; you have to build institutions (courts, police) for democracy to survive.
-   **Economic Growth:** Strong institutions (property rights) are the best predictor of wealth (Acemoglu).

## Criticism and Limitations
-   **Rigidity:** Institutions can be slow to adapt to new problems.
-   **Capture:** They can be taken over by special interests.
