## Overview
**Voting Systems** determine how votes are translated into seats. The same votes can produce wildly different results depending on the system used.

## Core Idea
The core idea is **representation**. How do we best reflect the will of the people?
-   **Majoritarian:** Winner takes all. Creates stability.
-   **Proportional:** Everyone gets a slice. Creates fairness.

## Formal Definition
-   **First Past the Post (FPTP):** The candidate with the most votes wins. (USA, UK). Leads to a two-party system (Duverger's Law).
-   **Proportional Representation (PR):** Parties get seats based on % of vote. (Most of Europe). Leads to multi-party coalitions.
-   **Ranked Choice (RCV):** Voters rank candidates. If no one gets 50%, the bottom candidate is eliminated and votes redistributed.

## Intuition
-   **FPTP:** Like a horse race. Only the winner matters. 49% of people can be unhappy.
-   **PR:** Like a pizza. If 10% want pepperoni, 10% of the pizza is pepperoni.

## Examples
-   **Gerrymandering:** Redrawing district lines to favor one party. A huge problem in FPTP systems.
-   **Spoiler Effect:** In FPTP, voting for a 3rd party (Green) can help the candidate you hate most (by splitting the vote). RCV fixes this.

## Common Misconceptions
-   **Misconception:** The candidate with the most votes always wins.
    -   **Correction:** Not in the US Electoral College (Trump 2016, Bush 2000).
-   **Misconception:** There is a perfect system.
    -   **Correction:** **Arrow's Impossibility Theorem** proves mathematically that no voting system is perfect (fair, transitive, and non-dictatorial).

## Related Concepts
-   **[Game Theory](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/economics/game-theory.md):** Strategic voting.
-   **[Democracy](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/political-science/democracy.md):** Relies on voting.
-   **[Social Choice Theory](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/economics/social-choice-theory.md):** The math of aggregating preferences.

## Applications
-   **Electoral Reform:** Debates over changing the system (e.g., FairVote).
-   **Oscars:** Use a form of Ranked Choice Voting.

## Criticism and Limitations
-   **Complexity:** PR and RCV can be confusing for voters.
-   **Instability:** PR can lead to weak coalition governments (like Italy or Israel).
