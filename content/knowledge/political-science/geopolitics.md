## Overview
**Geopolitics** is the study of how geography dictates destiny. Mountains, rivers, and oil fields determine which countries are powerful and which are invaded.

## Core Idea
The core idea is **location**. You can change your ideology, but you can't move your country.
-   **Sea Power:** Nations with navies (UK, USA) dominate trade.
-   **Land Power:** Nations with vast interiors (Russia, China) dominate resources.

## Formal Definition
The analysis of the geographic influences on power relationships in international relations.

## Intuition
-   **Russia:** Has no warm-water ports and flat borders (easy to invade). This makes them paranoid and aggressive.
-   **USA:** Protected by two oceans and has a massive river network (Mississippi) for trade. It plays on "Easy Mode."
-   **Middle East:** Has oil. Therefore, everyone cares about it.

## Examples
-   **The Heartland Theory (Mackinder):** "Who rules East Europe commands the Heartland; who rules the Heartland commands the World-Island; who rules the World-Island commands the world."
-   **Choke Points:** Narrow straits (Suez Canal, Strait of Hormuz) where global trade can be blocked.

## Common Misconceptions
-   **Misconception:** Technology makes geography irrelevant.
    -   **Correction:** Missiles fly far, but armies still need to cross mountains. The internet relies on undersea cables that follow geographic routes.

## Related Concepts
-   **[International Relations](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/political-science/international-relations.md):** Geopolitics is a realist subfield.
-   **[Imperialism](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/history/imperialism.md):** Often driven by geopolitical needs (bases, resources).
-   **[Resource Curse](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/economics/resource-curse.md):** Having too many resources can be bad for democracy.

## Applications
-   **Military Strategy:** Where to put bases.
-   **Energy Policy:** Pipelines are geopolitical weapons.

## Criticism and Limitations
-   **Determinism:** It can ignore human agency and culture. Geography is not *always* destiny.
