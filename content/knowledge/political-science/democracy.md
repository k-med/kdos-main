## Overview
**Democracy** (from Greek *demos* "people" + *kratos* "power") is rule by the people. It is the dominant form of government in the modern West, though it comes in many flavors.

## Core Idea
The core idea is **political equality**. Every citizen should have an equal say in how they are governed.

## Formal Definition
-   **Direct Democracy:** Citizens vote on laws directly (Ancient Athens).
-   **Representative Democracy (Republic):** Citizens elect officials to make laws (USA, UK).
-   **Liberal Democracy:** Democracy constrained by a constitution that protects individual rights (even from the majority).

## Intuition
It's **the worst form of government, except for all the others** (Churchill). It's messy, slow, and often frustrating, but it allows for peaceful transitions of power and accountability.

## Examples
-   **Parliamentary System:** The leader (Prime Minister) is chosen by the legislature (UK, Canada).
-   **Presidential System:** The leader is elected separately from the legislature (USA, Brazil).
-   **Referendum:** A direct vote on a specific issue (Brexit).

## Common Misconceptions
-   **Misconception:** Democracy = Freedom.
    -   **Correction:** Not always. "Illiberal Democracies" (like Hungary or Turkey) have elections but restrict press freedom and minority rights. This is the "Tyranny of the Majority."
-   **Misconception:** The US is a Democracy.
    -   **Correction:** Pedants say "It's a Republic." But a Republic is just a type of Representative Democracy. It is both.

## Related Concepts
-   **[Authoritarianism](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/political-science/authoritarianism.md):** The opposite of democracy.
-   **[Voting Systems](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/political-science/voting-systems.md):** How votes are counted (First Past the Post vs. Proportional Representation).
-   **[Civil Society](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/sociology/civil-society.md):** The organizations (NGOs, unions) that make democracy work.

## Applications
-   **Nation Building:** Trying to export democracy to other countries (often with mixed results).
-   **Corporate Governance:** Shareholder voting is a form of democracy.

## Criticism and Limitations
-   **Voter Ignorance:** Most voters are uninformed.
-   **Short-termism:** Politicians only care about the next election, not the next 50 years.
