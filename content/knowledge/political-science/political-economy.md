## Overview
**Political Economy** studies the intersection of politics and economics. It asks: How does the government affect the economy (taxes, regulations)? And how does the economy affect politics (lobbying, inequality)?

## Core Idea
The core idea is **allocation**. Who gets what? Markets allocate based on money; Politics allocates based on power. Political Economy studies the clash between the two.

## Formal Definition
The study of how political institutions, the political environment, and the economic system influence each other.

## Intuition
-   **Capitalism:** Private ownership. Efficiency. Inequality.
-   **Socialism:** Social ownership. Equality. Inefficiency (historically).
-   **Social Democracy:** A mix. Capitalist market + strong welfare state (Scandinavia).

## Examples
-   **The Welfare State:** Taxing the rich to provide healthcare/education for the poor.
-   **Central Banks:** Independent bodies (like the Fed) that control money supply, theoretically insulated from politics.
-   **Trade Wars:** Using tariffs (economics) to achieve political goals.

## Common Misconceptions
-   **Misconception:** The "Free Market" exists naturally.
    -   **Correction:** Markets require laws (property rights, contract enforcement) created by the state. There is no market without politics.
-   **Misconception:** Economics is just math.
    -   **Correction:** It is deeply political. Choosing to prioritize low inflation over low unemployment is a political choice.

## Related Concepts

-   **[Public Choice Theory](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/economics/public-choice-theory.md):** Applying economic logic (self-interest) to politicians.
-   **[Development](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/economics/development-economics.md):** Why are some nations rich and others poor?

## Applications
-   **Tax Policy:** Who should pay?
-   **Regulation:** Breaking up monopolies.

## Criticism and Limitations
-   **Ideology:** It's hard to separate objective analysis from political bias.
