## Overview
**Public Policy** is the "doing" part of government. It's not just speeches and elections; it's the actual laws, regulations, and programs that affect your life.

## Core Idea
The core idea is **problem solving**. Society has a problem (pollution, poverty, crime). Policy is the government's attempt to fix it.

## Formal Definition
The principled guide to action taken by the administrative executive branches of the state with regard to a class of issues.
**The Policy Cycle:**
1.  Agenda Setting (Identifying the problem).
2.  Formulation (Designing the solution).
3.  Adoption (Passing the law).
4.  Implementation (Running the program).
5.  Evaluation (Did it work?).

## Intuition
It's **social engineering**.
-   **Nudge:** Subtle policy changes (like making organ donation opt-out) to influence behavior.
-   **Carrot and Stick:** Incentives (tax breaks) and punishments (fines).

## Examples
-   **Healthcare:** Obamacare (ACA) vs. Single Payer. Different policy approaches to the same goal (health).
-   **Environment:** Carbon Tax vs. Cap and Trade.
-   **Education:** Standardized testing vs. school choice.

## Common Misconceptions
-   **Misconception:** Politicians write the laws.
    -   **Correction:** Most policy is written by unelected bureaucrats, experts, and lobbyists. Politicians just vote on it.
-   **Misconception:** Good policy always wins.
    -   **Correction:** Politics often kills good policy. (e.g., A carbon tax is economically efficient but politically toxic).

## Applications
-   **City Planning:** Zoning laws.
-   **Public Health:** Vaccination mandates.

## Criticism and Limitations
-   **Unintended Consequences:** Policies often backfire (e.g., Prohibition created organized crime).
-   **Implementation Gap:** Great ideas often fail because the bureaucracy can't execute them.
