## Overview
**Political Ideologies** are the lenses through which we see the world. They are systems of belief that explain how society works and how it *should* work.

## Core Idea
The core idea is **values**. Different ideologies prioritize different values (Freedom vs. Equality vs. Tradition).

## Formal Definition
A coherent set of ideas that provides the basis for organized political action.
-   **Liberalism:** Prioritizes individual liberty and rights.
-   **Conservatism:** Prioritizes tradition, order, and gradual change.
-   **Socialism:** Prioritizes social equality and collective ownership.

## Intuition
-   **The Left-Right Spectrum:** Originating from the French Revolution (supporters of the King on the right, revolutionaries on the left).
    -   **Left:** Change, Equality, Secularism.
    -   **Right:** Tradition, Hierarchy, Religion.

## Examples
-   **Fascism:** Extreme right. Ultranationalism, authoritarianism, "blood and soil."
-   **Anarchism:** Rejection of all hierarchy and the state. Can be left (Anarcho-Communism) or right (Anarcho-Capitalism).
-   **Environmentalism:** Ideology focused on ecology (Green Parties).

## Common Misconceptions
-   **Misconception:** Liberal means "Leftist."
    -   **Correction:** In the US, yes. In Europe/History, "Classical Liberalism" means free markets and small government (what Americans call Libertarianism).
-   **Misconception:** You have to fit in a box.
    -   **Correction:** Most people are syncretic (mix and match).

## Criticism and Limitations

-   **The Horseshoe Theory:** The far-left and far-right often resemble each other (authoritarianism, hatred of the establishment).
