## Overview
**International Relations (IR)** is the study of how countries interact. It's the "Wild West" of politics because there is no world government to enforce laws.

## Core Idea
The core idea is **anarchy**. Not chaos, but the absence of a higher authority. States must look out for themselves.

## Formal Definition
Major theories:
-   **Realism:** States are selfish actors obsessed with power and security. War is inevitable. (Machiavelli, Hobbes).
-   **Liberalism:** States can cooperate through trade and institutions (UN, EU) to create peace. (Kant).
-   **Constructivism:** Identity and ideas matter. Friends and enemies are social constructs.

## Intuition
-   **Realism:** A game of Risk. Trust no one. Build a big army.
-   **Liberalism:** A global market. Everyone gets rich if we trade and sign treaties.
-   **Constructivism:** High school. Who is "cool" or a "bully" depends on social perception.

## Examples
-   **Cold War:** A bipolar system (USA vs. USSR) defined by balance of power and nuclear deterrence (MAD).
-   **European Union:** A liberal project to stop war by integrating economies.
-   **Globalization:** The increasing interconnectedness of the world.

## Common Misconceptions
-   **Misconception:** The UN is a world government.
    -   **Correction:** It has no army and little power. It's a forum for discussion, dependent on member states.
-   **Misconception:** Democracies don't go to war.
    -   **Correction:** "Democratic Peace Theory" says they don't fight *each other*, but they fight plenty of wars against non-democracies.

## Related Concepts
-   **[Geopolitics](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/political-science/geopolitics.md):** How geography influences politics (resources, borders).
-   **[Diplomacy](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/political-science/diplomacy.md):** The art of negotiation.
-   **[Sovereignty](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/political-science/sovereignty.md):** The absolute authority of a state within its borders.

## Applications
-   **Foreign Policy:** Deciding whether to sign a trade deal or impose sanctions.
-   **Conflict Resolution:** Ending civil wars.

## Criticism and Limitations
-   **Eurocentrism:** IR theory is heavily based on European history (Westphalian system) and may not apply to the Global South.
