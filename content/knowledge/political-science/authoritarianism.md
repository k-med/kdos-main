## Overview
**Authoritarianism** is rule by the few (or the one) without the consent of the many. It prioritizes order and control over individual freedom.

## Core Idea
The core idea is **obedience**. The state is the ultimate authority, and dissent is not tolerated.

## Formal Definition
A regime type characterized by:
1.  Limited political pluralism (no real opposition parties).
2.  Legitimacy based on emotion (nationalism) or performance (economic growth), not elections.
3.  Executive power that is vague and shifting.

## Intuition
It's the **strict parent** model of government. "Do what I say because I know best."
-   **Dictatorship:** Rule by one person.
-   **Oligarchy:** Rule by a small group (junta, party).
-   **Totalitarianism:** Extreme authoritarianism that tries to control every aspect of life (thoughts, art, family). (e.g., North Korea, Nazi Germany).

## Examples
-   **China:** A one-party state that allows economic freedom but no political freedom.
-   **Saudi Arabia:** An absolute monarchy.
-   **Russia:** A "managed democracy" where elections happen, but the outcome is predetermined.

## Common Misconceptions
-   **Misconception:** Authoritarian regimes are always unstable.
    -   **Correction:** Some (like the CCP in China) have lasted for decades by delivering economic growth and using sophisticated surveillance.
-   **Misconception:** They are all violent.
    -   **Correction:** Modern "soft authoritarianism" uses legal harassment and media control rather than firing squads.

## Related Concepts
-   **[Fascism](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/political-science/fascism.md):** Far-right ultranationalist authoritarianism.
-   **[Communism](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/political-science/communism.md):** Often devolves into authoritarianism (Stalinism) despite egalitarian goals.
-   **[Propaganda](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/political-science/propaganda.md):** Information used to promote a political cause.

## Applications
-   **Foreign Policy:** How democracies should deal with dictators (Sanctions? Engagement?).
-   **History:** Understanding the rise of Hitler and Stalin.

## Criticism and Limitations
-   **Succession Crisis:** Dictators rarely have a clear plan for who takes over when they die, leading to chaos.
-   **Information Problem:** Subordinates lie to the dictator to please him, so he makes bad decisions (e.g., Putin invading Ukraine).
