## Overview
**Pantheism** (Greek *pan* "all" + *theos* "god") is the belief that God and the Universe are the same thing. God is not a distant creator; God is the *stuff* of existence.

## Core Idea
The core idea is **Immanence**. The divine is right here, in the trees, the stars, and you. "Deus sive Natura" (God or Nature).

## Formal Definition
The view that the Universe (Nature) and God are identical. Pantheists do not believe in a personal, anthropomorphic God.

## Intuition
-   **The Ocean:** Individual things are like waves. The waves rise and fall, but they are all just water. The water is God.
-   **"The Force":** Like in Star Wars (mostly). An energy field created by all living things, binding the galaxy together.

## Examples
-   **Spinoza:** The most famous Western pantheist. He was excommunicated for saying God has a body (the universe).
-   **Stoicism:** The Stoics believed in a divine "Logos" that permeated all matter.
-   **Deep Ecology:** Revering the earth as sacred.

## Common Misconceptions
-   **Misconception:** It's just "sexed-up atheism."
    -   **Correction:** Atheists see the universe as dead matter. Pantheists see it as sacred, alive, and divine. The *attitude* is religious.
-   **Misconception:** They worship rocks.
    -   **Correction:** They worship the *Totality* of which the rock is a part.

## Related Concepts
-   **[Panentheism](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/theology/panentheism.md):** God is *in* everything, but also *more* than the universe (The universe is God's body, but God also has a mind).
-   **[Monism](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/philosophy/monism.md):** All is one.

## Applications
-   **Environmentalism:** If the Earth is God's body, polluting is a sin.
-   **Spirituality:** Finding the divine in nature rather than a church.

## Criticism and Limitations
-   **No Personal Relationship:** You can't pray to the universe. It doesn't care about you.
-   **Problem of Evil:** If everything is God, then cancer and murder are also God.
