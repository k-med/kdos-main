## Overview
**Atheism** is the position that there are no deities. It is often associated with a reliance on science, reason, and humanism to explain the universe and guide morality.

## Core Idea
The core idea is **Naturalism**. The natural world is all there is. There is no supernatural realm, no divine intervention, and no "ghost in the machine."

## Formal Definition
-   **Negative Atheism:** Lack of belief in God (like a baby or someone who has never heard of God).
-   **Positive Atheism:** The assertion that God does *not* exist.

## Intuition
-   **The Invisible Gardener:** If you claim there is an invisible, intangible gardener tending a plot, and we test for him and find nothing, at what point do we say he doesn't exist?
-   **"One Less God":** Monotheists reject thousands of gods (Zeus, Thor, Ra). Atheists just go one god further.

## Examples
-   **New Atheism:** A militant form of atheism (Dawkins, Hitchens) that views religion as harmful superstition.
-   **Existential Atheism:** Sartre, Camus. If there is no God, life has no inherent meaning; we must create our own.

## Common Misconceptions
-   **Misconception:** Atheists have no morals.
    -   **Correction:** Secular Humanism provides a robust ethical framework based on empathy, reason, and human flourishing.
-   **Misconception:** It's a "faith" in itself.
    -   **Correction:** Most atheists view it as the *null hypothesis*—the default position until evidence is presented.

## Related Concepts
-   **[Agnosticism](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/theology/agnosticism.md):** "I don't know" or "It cannot be known."
-   **[Materialism](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/philosophy/materialism.md):** Only matter exists.
-   **[Theism](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/theology/theism.md):** The opposite.

## Applications
-   **Secularism:** Separation of church and state.
-   **Science:** Methodological naturalism (doing science as if God doesn't intervene).

## Criticism and Limitations
-   **Nihilism:** Without a higher power, some argue there is no objective basis for morality or meaning.
-   **Fine-Tuning:** The universe seems suspiciously well-calibrated for life.
