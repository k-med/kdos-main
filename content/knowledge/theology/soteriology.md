## Overview
**Soteriology** (Greek *soter* "savior") asks: "What is wrong with us, and how do we fix it?" It is the theory of salvation, liberation, or enlightenment.

## Core Idea
The core idea is **Transformation**. Humans are in a bad state (sin, ignorance, suffering), and we need to move to a good state (heaven, nirvana, communion).

## Formal Definition
The branch of theology dealing with the nature and means of salvation.

## Intuition
-   **The Rescue:** We are drowning. Soteriology is the life raft.
-   **The Medicine:** We are sick. Soteriology is the cure.
-   **The Debt:** We owe a debt we can't pay. Soteriology is who pays it.

## Examples
-   **Christianity:** Humans are sinful. Jesus' death (Atonement) pays the penalty. Salvation is by Grace through Faith.
-   **Buddhism:** Humans suffer due to attachment. The Eightfold Path leads to Nirvana (liberation).
-   **Hinduism:** Humans are trapped in Samsara (rebirth) by Karma. Moksha is liberation from the cycle.

## Common Misconceptions
-   **Misconception:** It's just about going to heaven when you die.
    -   **Correction:** Many traditions view salvation as a present reality (Enlightenment now, Kingdom of God now).
-   **Misconception:** All religions have the same soteriology.
    -   **Correction:** They solve different problems. Christianity solves Sin; Buddhism solves Suffering.

## Related Concepts
-   **[Theism](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/theology/theism.md):** In theism, God saves.
-   **[Eschatology](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/theology/eschatology.md):** Salvation is often the final destination.

## Applications
-   **Psychology:** "Self-help" is often a secular soteriology (saving yourself from anxiety).
-   **Politics:** Marxism is a secular soteriology (saving the world through revolution).

## Criticism and Limitations
-   **Exclusivism:** "My way is the only way." This causes conflict.
