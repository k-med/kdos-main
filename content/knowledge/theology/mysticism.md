## Overview
**Mysticism** is the pursuit of direct, unmediated contact with the Divine. It's not about believing *doctrines*; it's about *experiencing* God.

## Core Idea
The core idea is **Union**. The goal is to dissolve the boundary between the self and the Absolute (God, Brahman, The One).

## Formal Definition
A constellation of practices and discourses that aim at direct knowledge of ultimate reality or union with the divine.
-   **Ineffability:** The experience cannot be put into words.
-   **Noetic Quality:** It feels like deep knowledge, not just emotion.

## Intuition
-   **The Drop and the Ocean:** The mystic seeks to be the drop of water falling back into the ocean, losing its individual identity to become part of the vast whole.
-   **Falling in Love:** You can read about love, but *feeling* it is a different mode of knowing. Mysticism is falling in love with God.

## Examples
-   **Sufism (Islam):** Rumi, whirling dervishes. Seeking to annihilate the ego in Allah.
-   **Christian Mysticism:** St. John of the Cross, Teresa of Avila. "The Dark Night of the Soul."
-   **Kabbalah (Judaism):** Esoteric interpretation of scripture.
-   **Zen Buddhism:** Satori (sudden enlightenment).

## Common Misconceptions
-   **Misconception:** It's magic or fortune-telling.
    -   **Correction:** True mysticism is usually about inner transformation and surrender, not powers.
-   **Misconception:** It's anti-rational.
    -   **Correction:** It is *trans-rational*. It goes beyond where reason can reach.

## Related Concepts
-   **[Theism](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/theology/theism.md):** Most mystics operate within a theistic tradition.
-   **[Pantheism](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/theology/pantheism.md):** Mystical experiences often feel pantheistic (All is One).

## Applications
-   **Meditation:** Techniques for quieting the mind.
-   **Interfaith Dialogue:** Mystics of different religions often understand each other better than the dogmatists do. "The lamps are different, but the Light is the same."

## Criticism and Limitations
-   **Subjectivity:** You can't prove your vision to anyone else. It could be a hallucination.
-   **Antinomianism:** Some mystics claim they are above moral laws.
