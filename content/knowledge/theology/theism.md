## Overview
**Theism** is the belief that at the bottom of everything, there is a Person, not just a Force. It posits a conscious, intentional Creator who is distinct from the universe but interacts with it.

## Core Idea
The core idea is **Personal Agency**. The universe isn't an accident; it's an artifact. It was made by a Mind.

## Formal Definition
Belief in the existence of a god or gods, specifically of a creator who intervenes in the universe.
-   **Monotheism:** One God (Judaism, Christianity, Islam).
-   **Polytheism:** Many Gods (Hinduism, Greek Mythology).

## Intuition
-   **The Watchmaker:** If you find a watch on the beach, you assume a watchmaker. The universe is more complex than a watch; therefore, it has a Maker. (Teleological Argument).
-   **The Parent:** God is often conceptualized as a Father or Mother—an authority figure who loves, guides, and disciplines.

## Examples
-   **Abrahamic Faiths:** Yahweh, God, Allah.
-   **Classical Theism:** God is omnipotent (all-powerful), omniscient (all-knowing), and omnibenevolent (all-good).

## Common Misconceptions
-   **Misconception:** It's just "wishful thinking."
    -   **Correction:** Many theists base their belief on philosophical arguments (Cosmological, Moral) or personal experience, not just comfort.
-   **Misconception:** God is just a "big man in the sky."
    -   **Correction:** Sophisticated theism views God as the *Ground of Being* itself, not just a being *within* the universe.

## Related Concepts
-   **[Deism](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/theology/deism.md):** God created the universe but doesn't intervene (The Clockmaker).
-   **[Atheism](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/theology/atheism.md):** The denial of theism.
-   **[Pantheism](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/theology/pantheism.md):** God *is* the universe.

## Applications
-   **Ethics:** Divine Command Theory (Good is what God commands).
-   **Meaning:** Purpose is defined by the Creator.

## Criticism and Limitations
-   **Problem of Evil:** If God is all-good and all-powerful, why does evil exist?
-   **Divine Hiddenness:** Why doesn't God reveal himself more clearly?
