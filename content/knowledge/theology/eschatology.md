## Overview
**Eschatology** (Greek *eschatos* "last") is the study of "The End." It covers the end of your life (death), the end of the world (apocalypse), and what comes after (heaven/hell).

## Core Idea
The core idea is **Telos** (Purpose/Goal). History isn't just one damn thing after another; it is heading somewhere. There is a finale.

## Formal Definition
The theology of last things.
-   **Personal Eschatology:** Death, immortality, judgment.
-   **Cosmic Eschatology:** The end of the age, the return of God, the new creation.

## Intuition
-   **The Third Act:** In a movie, the third act resolves the conflict. Eschatology is the belief that the universe has a third act where justice is done and loose ends are tied up.
-   **The Horizon:** It's what we look toward. It shapes how we walk today.

## Examples
-   **Christianity:** The Second Coming of Christ, Resurrection of the Dead, Last Judgment.
-   **Islam:** The Day of Qiyamah.
-   **Secular Eschatology:** The Heat Death of the Universe, the Singularity, or Climate Collapse.

## Common Misconceptions
-   **Misconception:** It's just "doom and gloom."
    -   **Correction:** For believers, it is usually a message of *hope*. Evil will be defeated; tears will be wiped away.
-   **Misconception:** It's about predicting dates.
    -   **Correction:** Most traditions warn *against* predicting dates. It's about readiness.

## Related Concepts
-   **[Theodicy](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/theology/theodicy.md):** Eschatology is often the answer to the problem of evil (justice will be done *later*).
-   **[Soteriology](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/theology/soteriology.md):** Salvation is often eschatological (saved from judgment).

## Applications
-   **Ethics:** If you believe the world will be renewed, you might care for it. If you believe it will burn, you might not.
-   **Politics:** "Messianic" political movements often promise a secular utopia (eschaton).

## Criticism and Limitations
-   **Escapism:** "Pie in the sky when you die" can make people tolerate injustice now.
