## Overview
**Hermeneutics** is the art and science of reading. It asks: "How do we understand a text written thousands of years ago in a different culture?"

## Core Idea
The core idea is **Context**. You cannot understand a text without understanding the world it came from and the world you are reading it in.

## Formal Definition
The theory and methodology of interpretation.
-   **Exegesis:** Drawing meaning *out* of the text (Good).
-   **Eisegesis:** Reading meaning *into* the text (Bad).

## Intuition
-   **The Lens:** We all wear glasses colored by our culture, gender, and time period. Hermeneutics is studying the glasses so we can see the text clearly.
-   **The Hermeneutic Circle:** To understand the whole, you need the parts. To understand the parts, you need the whole. You go round and round.

## Examples
-   **Literal vs. Metaphorical:** When the Bible says "God's arm," is it a physical arm or a metaphor for power? Hermeneutics decides.
-   **Constitutional Law:** Originalism vs. Living Constitution. This is legal hermeneutics.

## Common Misconceptions
-   **Misconception:** The text just "says what it says."
    -   **Correction:** Every reading is an interpretation. "I take it literally" is an interpretive choice.
-   **Misconception:** It makes truth relative.
    -   **Correction:** It acknowledges complexity, but usually aims for the *best* interpretation, not just *any* interpretation.

## Related Concepts
-   **[Epistemology](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/philosophy/epistemology.md):** How do we know what the text means?
-   **[Postmodernism](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/philosophy/postmodernism.md):** Heavily focused on hermeneutics (Death of the Author).

## Applications
-   **Law:** Interpreting statutes.
-   **History:** Interpreting primary sources.
-   **Theology:** Preaching and doctrine.

## Criticism and Limitations
-   **Subjectivity:** Can we ever truly know the author's intent? (The Intentional Fallacy).
