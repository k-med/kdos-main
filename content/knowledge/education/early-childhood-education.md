## Overview
The first five years are critical. 90% of a child's brain develops before age 5. ECE isn't just babysitting; it's the foundation for all future learning.

## Core Idea
**Play-Based Learning:** Children learn best through play. It's not "just playing"; it's how they explore the world, learn social skills, and solve problems.

## Formal Definition (if applicable)
**Developmentally Appropriate Practice (DAP):** Teaching that is grounded in research on how children develop and learn, and what is known about effective early education.

## Intuition
You don't teach a 3-year-old calculus. You teach them to share blocks. If they can't share blocks, they won't be able to work on a team at Google later.

## Examples
- **Montessori:** Child-led learning with specific materials.
- **Reggio Emilia:** Project-based, artistic, and community-focused.
- **Head Start:** A US program for low-income children.

## Common Misconceptions
- "Earlier is better for academics." (Pushing reading too early can backfire. Social-emotional skills are more important at this age.)
- "Preschool is a luxury." (It has the highest ROI of any educational investment—$7 to $10 for every $1 invested.)

## Related Concepts
- **Emergent Literacy:** The earliest signs of reading and writing (scribbling, holding a book).
- **Attachment Theory:** The importance of a secure bond with a caregiver.
- **Executive Function:** Self-regulation, working memory, and focus.

## Applications
- **Parenting:** Understanding your child's development.
- **Policy:** Universal Pre-K.
- **Health:** Early intervention for delays.

## Criticism / Limitations
Low pay for ECE teachers leads to high turnover and lower quality.
