## Overview
"Play is the work of the child." Maria Montessori, an Italian doctor, realized that kids aren't just empty vessels to be filled with facts. They are little scientists who learn by touching, moving, and doing. In a Montessori school, there are no desks in rows. Kids choose what they want to work on.

## Core Idea
The core idea is **Follow the Child**. Trust that the child knows what they need to learn next. If they are obsessed with pouring water, let them pour water until they master it.

## Formal Definition
A child-centered educational approach based on scientific observations of children.
Key Elements: **Mixed Age Classrooms**, **Student Choice**, **Prepared Environment**.

## Intuition
-   **Traditional School:** A factory. Everyone learns the same thing at the same time. (Batch processing).
-   **Montessori:** A garden. Each plant grows at its own pace. The teacher is the gardener who provides the right soil and water, but doesn't pull on the plant to make it grow faster.

## Examples
-   **The Pink Tower:** A set of blocks that teaches size and dimension. The child builds it. If it falls, they learn gravity. The material corrects the child, not the teacher.
-   **Practical Life:** Kids learn to tie shoes, wash dishes, and cut fruit. Real skills, not just abstract math.

## Common Misconceptions
-   **It's chaotic:** It's actually very structured. "Freedom within limits." You can choose any activity, but you must use it correctly and put it away when you are done.
-   **It's just for rich kids:** It started in the slums of Rome for poor children.

## Related Concepts
-   **Sensitive Periods:** Windows of time when a child is super-ready to learn something (e.g., Language from age 0-6).
-   **Absorbent Mind:** The sponge-like ability of young children to learn without effort.

## Applications
-   **Google & Amazon:** The founders of Google (Larry Page, Sergey Brin) and Amazon (Jeff Bezos) were all Montessori kids. They credit it for their ability to think differently.

## Criticism / Limitations
-   **Transition:** It can be hard for Montessori kids to switch to a traditional school later, where they have to sit still and listen to a teacher.
