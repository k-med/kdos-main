## Overview
What if schools actually *prevent* learning? Ivan Illich argued that schools are just factories that produce compliant consumers. They confuse "teaching" with "learning" and "grade advancement" with "education." He proposed abolishing schools entirely.

## Core Idea
The core idea is **Institutionalization**. We have turned learning (a natural human activity) into a commodity (Schooling) that must be bought from a certified professional.

## Formal Definition
A critique of compulsory education arguing that the institutionalization of education tends to institutionalize society and that "schooling" is often confused with "learning."
Author: **Ivan Illich**.

## Intuition
-   **The Hospital:** We think health comes from doctors.
-   **The School:** We think wisdom comes from teachers.
-   **Illich's View:** Health comes from living well. Wisdom comes from living fully. Institutions make us dependent and helpless.

## Examples
-   **Learning Webs:** Illich proposed replacing schools with "Learning Webs" (basically the Internet, 20 years before it existed). People who want to learn a skill connect with people who want to teach it. No grades, no degrees, just learning.
-   **Credentialism:** We hire people based on their degree (the piece of paper), not their actual skill. This forces everyone to stay in school for 16 years just to get the paper.

## Common Misconceptions
-   **He hated learning:** No, he loved learning. He hated *school*. He thought school killed the curiosity that makes learning possible.

## Related Concepts
-   **Hidden Curriculum:** Illich argued that the main thing school teaches is that "you need school."
-   **Convivial Tools:** Tools that empower people (like a bicycle or a library) vs. Manipulative Tools (like a factory or a school).

## Applications
-   **Unschooling:** The modern movement of parents who let their kids learn without school is based on Illich's ideas.

## Criticism / Limitations
-   **Inequality:** Without public schools, how would poor kids learn to read? Illich's vision might only work for the motivated and wealthy.
