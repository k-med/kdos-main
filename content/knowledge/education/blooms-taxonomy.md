  Bloom's taxonomy is a set of three hierarchical models used to classify educational learning objectives into levels of complexity and specificity. The three lists cover the learning objectives in cognitive, affective and sensory domains.

## Overview
Not all thinking is the same. Remembering a phone number is easy. Designing a spaceship is hard. Bloom's Taxonomy is a pyramid that ranks thinking skills from simple to complex. Teachers use it to make sure they aren't just teaching kids to memorize facts.

## Core Idea
The core idea is **Levels of Thinking**. You have to crawl before you can walk. You have to Remember before you can Understand, and Understand before you can Create.

## Formal Definition
A hierarchical model used to classify educational learning objectives into levels of complexity.
**The Levels (Revised):** Remember, Understand, Apply, Analyze, Evaluate, Create.

## Intuition
-   **The Pyramid:**
    -   **Bottom (Remember):** "What is the capital of France?" (Paris).
    -   **Middle (Apply):** "Calculate the distance from Paris to London."
    -   **Top (Create):** "Design a new transportation system for Paris."

## Examples
-   **Bad Test:** A test that only asks multiple-choice questions about dates and names. It only tests the bottom level (Remembering).
-   **Good Project:** "Build a bridge out of popsicle sticks." This requires Analysis (physics), Evaluation (testing), and Creation (building).

## Common Misconceptions
-   **Higher is always better:** No. You *need* the bottom levels. You can't analyze the causes of WWII if you don't remember who fought in it. The goal is to master *all* levels.

## Related Concepts
-   **Metacognition:** Thinking about thinking. "How do I learn best?"
-   **Depth of Knowledge (Webb):** A similar model, but focused on how deep you have to think, not just the type of thinking.

## Applications
-   **Lesson Planning:** Teachers write objectives like: "Students will be able to *evaluate* the impact of..." instead of "Students will *know*..."

## Criticism / Limitations
-   **Rigidity:** Thinking isn't always linear. Sometimes you "Create" something first (messing around with code) and then "Understand" how it works later.
