## Overview
Schools don't exist in a vacuum. They are shaped by laws, budgets, and politics. Educational policy is where the rubber meets the road.

## Core Idea
**Equity vs. Equality:**
- **Equality:** Giving everyone the same thing (same funding per student).
- **Equity:** Giving everyone what they need (more funding for poor students to close the gap).

## Formal Definition (if applicable)
**School Choice:** Policies that allow families to choose which school their children attend (charter schools, vouchers), rather than being assigned by zip code.

## Intuition
It's a battleground.
- **Left:** Wants more funding, stronger unions, and equity.
- **Right:** Wants more choice, accountability, and efficiency.

## Examples
- **No Child Left Behind (NCLB):** A US law that mandated standardized testing.
- **Vouchers:** Using public money to pay for private school tuition.
- **Title IX:** Prohibiting sex discrimination in education.

## Common Misconceptions
- "Money doesn't matter." (It does, especially for low-income students, but *how* you spend it matters more.)
- "Private schools are better." (When you control for socioeconomic status, the difference often disappears.)

## Related Concepts
- **Achievement Gap:** The disparity in academic performance between groups of students.
- **Teacher Unions:** Powerful political actors.
- **Desegregation:** The legal effort to end racial segregation in schools.

## Applications
- **Elections:** Education is a top voter issue.
- **Civil Rights:** Ensuring equal access.
- **Economics:** Education as an investment in the future workforce.

## Criticism / Limitations
Policies are often made by politicians who have never taught a day in their lives. Unintended consequences are common.
