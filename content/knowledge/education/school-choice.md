## Overview
In most places, your zip code determines your school. If you live in a rich neighborhood, you get a good school. If you live in a poor neighborhood, you get a bad school. School Choice says: "That's unfair. Parents should be able to pick their school, just like they pick their grocery store."

## Core Idea
The core idea is **Competition**. If schools have to compete for students (and the money that comes with them), they will improve. Bad schools will go out of business.

## Formal Definition
Programs offering students alternatives to publicly provided schools assigned by residence.
Types: **Vouchers**, **Charter Schools**, **Magnet Schools**.

## Intuition
-   **The Monopoly:** Public schools are a monopoly. They have no incentive to improve because you *have* to go there.
-   **The Market:** School Choice introduces market forces. "Customer Service" for education.

## Examples
-   **Vouchers:** The government gives you a coupon (worth $10,000) representing your tax dollars. You can use it to pay tuition at a private school or a religious school.
-   **Charter Schools:** Publicly funded but privately run. They have more freedom (longer days, different curriculum) but must get good results to stay open. (e.g., KIPP, Success Academy).

## Common Misconceptions
-   **It destroys public schools:** Critics say it drains money from the public system, leaving the poorest kids in even worse schools. Proponents say it forces public schools to get better.

## Related Concepts
-   **Cream Skimming:** The fear that private schools will only take the smart, easy-to-teach kids, leaving the special needs and "difficult" kids in the public system.

## Applications
-   **Urban Education:** School choice is most popular in inner cities where public schools have historically failed poor minority students.

## Criticism / Limitations
-   **Segregation:** Critics argue that school choice leads to more segregation, as parents self-segregate by race and class.
