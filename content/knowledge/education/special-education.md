## Overview
Education is a right, not a privilege. Special education ensures that students with disabilities (autism, dyslexia, ADHD, etc.) get the support they need to succeed.

## Core Idea
**LRE (Least Restrictive Environment):** Students should be educated with their non-disabled peers to the maximum extent appropriate. Segregation is the last resort.

## Formal Definition (if applicable)
**IEP (Individualized Education Program):** A legal document that lays out the plan for a special education student. It includes goals, accommodations, and services.

## Intuition
If a student can't see the board, you don't kick them out. You give them glasses (accommodation). If they can't read the textbook, you give them an audiobook. It's about leveling the playing field.

## Examples
- **Inclusion:** A student with Down syndrome attending a regular math class.
- **Resource Room:** A student going to a separate room for extra help with reading.
- **Accommodations:** Extra time on tests, preferential seating.

## Common Misconceptions
- "Special Ed is a place." (It's a service, not a room.)
- "It's only for 'slow' kids." (It also includes Gifted and Talented education.)

## Related Concepts
- **504 Plan:** A plan for students who need accommodations but not specialized instruction (e.g., a student with diabetes).
- **Universal Design for Learning (UDL):** Designing lessons that work for *everyone* from the start.
- **Neurodiversity:** Viewing conditions like autism as natural variations, not deficits.

## Applications
- **Law:** IDEA (Individuals with Disabilities Education Act) in the US.
- **Psychology:** Diagnosing learning disabilities.
- **Advocacy:** Fighting for disability rights.

## Criticism / Limitations
Over-identification of minority students in special education. Under-funding and high teacher burnout.
