## Overview
From the chalkboard to the iPad, technology has always been part of the classroom. Today, EdTech promises to personalize learning, democratize access, and make school more engaging.

## Core Idea
**SAMR Model:** A framework for integrating technology.
1.  **Substitution:** Tech acts as a direct tool substitute (typing instead of writing).
2.  **Augmentation:** Tech acts as a direct tool substitute with functional improvement (spell check).
3.  **Modification:** Tech allows for significant task redesign (collaborating on a Google Doc).
4.  **Redefinition:** Tech allows for new tasks, previously inconceivable (video calling an expert in Antarctica).

## Formal Definition (if applicable)
**Adaptive Learning:** An educational method which uses computer algorithms to orchestrate the interaction with the learner and deliver customized resources and learning activities to address the unique needs of each learner.

## Intuition
A textbook is static. It's the same for everyone. EdTech is dynamic. It can speed up if you're bored, slow down if you're confused, and show you a video if you don't like reading.

## Examples
- **LMS (Learning Management System):** Canvas, Blackboard, Google Classroom.
- **MOOCs (Massive Open Online Courses):** Coursera, edX.
- **Gamification:** Duolingo (earning XP and badges for learning).

## Common Misconceptions
- "Tech replaces teachers." (Tech amplifies good teaching but can't replace the human connection.)
- "Digital natives know how to use tech for learning." (They know how to use TikTok, not necessarily how to research or code.)

## Related Concepts
- **Flipped Classroom:** Watch lectures at home, do homework in class.
- **Blended Learning:** Mixing face-to-face and online instruction.
- **Digital Divide:** The gap between those who have access to tech and those who don't.

## Applications
- **Remote Learning:** Zoom school during the pandemic.
- **Accessibility:** Text-to-speech for blind students.
- **Data Analytics:** Tracking student progress to intervene early.

## Criticism / Limitations
Screen time concerns, privacy issues, and the high cost of devices. "shiny object syndrome" (buying tech without a plan).
