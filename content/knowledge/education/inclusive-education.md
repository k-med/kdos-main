  Inclusive education is a model of education where students with special needs spend most or all of their time with non-special needs (general education) students. It arises from the belief that education is a fundamental human right and the foundation for a more just society.

## Overview
In the past, kids with disabilities were sent to "Special Schools" or hidden in the basement. Inclusive Education says: "Everyone belongs in the same classroom." It benefits the disabled kid (socialization) and the non-disabled kid (empathy).

## Core Idea
The core idea is **Least Restrictive Environment (LRE)**. The law says a child should be in a regular classroom as much as possible, with support.

## Formal Definition
A system where students with special needs learn alongside their non-disabled peers.
**Mainstreaming:** Placing a special needs child in a regular class.

## Intuition
-   **Segregation:** Separate but equal. (Never actually equal).
-   **Inclusion:** The ramp. Building a ramp for a wheelchair helps the wheelchair user, but it also helps the mom with a stroller and the delivery guy. Designing for the margins helps everyone.

## Examples
-   **Co-Teaching:** Two teachers in one room. One General Ed, one Special Ed. They help everyone.
-   **Universal Design for Learning (UDL):** Presenting information in multiple ways (Text, Audio, Video) so that *everyone* can access it, not just the blind or deaf.

## Common Misconceptions
-   **It slows down the class:** Studies show that "typical" kids in inclusive classrooms do just as well academically, and have better social skills.
-   **It's cheaper:** It's actually expensive. You need aides, therapists, and special equipment. But it's a moral imperative.

## Related Concepts
-   **IEP (Individualized Education Program):** The legal document that spells out exactly what support a special needs child will get.
-   **Neurodiversity:** The idea that Autism/ADHD are not "diseases" to be cured, but different ways of thinking.

## Applications
-   **Workplace Inclusion:** Companies hiring people with Autism for their attention to detail.

## Criticism / Limitations
-   **Behavior:** If a child is violent or disruptive, they can make it impossible for others to learn. There are limits to inclusion.
