## Overview
For most of human history, everyone was homeschooled. The idea of sending kids to a building for 8 hours a day is very new (Industrial Revolution). Today, millions of parents are opting out of the system to teach their kids themselves.

## Core Idea
The core idea is **Customization**. The school system is "One Size Fits All." Homeschooling is "Bespoke Suit." You can tailor the curriculum to the child's interests and pace.

## Formal Definition
The education of children at home or a variety of places other than school, usually conducted by a parent.
**Unschooling:** A radical version where there is no curriculum at all. The child learns by living.

## Intuition
-   **The Factory vs. The Studio:**
    -   **School:** Bells, rows, standardized tests. Efficient for the state.
    -   **Home:** Reading on the couch, going to museums, cooking. Efficient for the individual.

## Examples
-   **Religious Homeschooling:** Parents who want to teach their values without secular influence.
-   **Secular Homeschooling:** Parents who think schools are too rigid, too test-focused, or unsafe (bullying).
-   **Pandemic Pods:** During COVID, neighbors hired a teacher to teach 5-6 kids in a living room. A hybrid model.

## Common Misconceptions
-   **They have no friends:** "What about socialization?" Homeschoolers actually have *more* diverse social lives. They interact with adults, old people, and kids of all ages at the library/park, rather than just 30 kids of their exact same age.

## Related Concepts
-   **Deschooling:** The period of time it takes for a kid to "detox" from the school mindset (waiting to be told what to do) after leaving school.

## Applications
-   **Gifted Kids:** Often bored in school. Homeschooling lets them do Calculus at age 10.
-   **Special Needs:** Kids with ADHD often thrive at home where they can move around.

## Criticism / Limitations
-   **Privilege:** You need a parent who can afford to stay home and not work. Single moms usually can't homeschool.
-   **Quality Control:** Some parents are bad teachers. Some kids slip through the cracks and learn nothing.
