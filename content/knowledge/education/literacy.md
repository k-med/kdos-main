## Overview
Reading is not natural. Speaking is natural (every human does it). Reading is a technology we invented 5,000 years ago. It rewires the brain. Literacy is the foundation of all other education. If you can't read, you can't learn history, science, or math.

## Core Idea
The core idea is **Decoding**. Turning squiggles on a page into sounds and meaning in your head.

## Formal Definition
The ability to read and write.
**Functional Literacy:** Reading well enough to function in society (read a menu, fill out a job application).

## Intuition
-   **The Code:** English is a code. "C-A-T" stands for the sound /kat/. You have to crack the code (Phonics) before you can understand the message (Comprehension).

## Examples
-   **The Reading Wars:** The 100-year battle between "Phonics" (teaching letter sounds) and "Whole Language" (guessing words based on context).
-   **Science of Reading:** The verdict is in. Phonics wins. Brain scans show that good readers decode every letter, they just do it really fast.

## Common Misconceptions
-   **Reading comes naturally:** No. It must be explicitly taught.
-   **Dyslexia is seeing letters backwards:** No. It's a problem with processing sounds (Phonemic Awareness).

## Related Concepts
-   **Digital Literacy:** The ability to navigate the internet and tell fake news from real news.
-   **Aliteracy:** People who *can* read but *choose* not to.

## Applications
-   **Prison Pipeline:** 70% of inmates cannot read above a 4th-grade level. Literacy is the best crime prevention.

## Criticism / Limitations
-   **Cultural Bias:** Standardized reading tests often use passages about things poor kids haven't experienced (like sailing or skiing), making them harder to understand.
