  Learning disabilities are neurologically-based processing problems. These processing problems can interfere with learning basic skills such as reading, writing and/or math. They can also interfere with higher level skills such as organization, time planning, abstract reasoning, long or short term memory and attention.

## Overview
If a kid can't read, we used to call them "lazy" or "stupid." Now we know their brain is just wired differently. Learning Disabilities (LD) are not about intelligence; they are about *processing*. It's like having a supercomputer with a faulty keyboard. The data is there, but you can't get it in or out easily.

## Core Idea
The core idea is **The Discrepancy**. A learning disability is when there is a gap between a child's *potential* (IQ) and their *achievement* (Grades). If a smart kid is failing, look for an LD.

## Formal Definition
Neurologically-based processing problems that interfere with learning basic skills.
Common Types: **Dyslexia** (Reading), **Dysgraphia** (Writing), **Dyscalculia** (Math).

## Intuition
-   **The Operating System:**
    -   **Typical Brain:** Windows.
    -   **LD Brain:** Linux. It's powerful, but it doesn't run the standard software (School) without some tweaking.
-   **Glasses:** We give glasses to kids with bad eyes. We give "Accommodations" (extra time, audiobooks) to kids with LDs. It's not cheating; it's leveling the playing field.

## Examples
-   **Dyslexia:** The most common. It's not seeing letters backwards; it's trouble matching sounds to letters. Einstein and Richard Branson are dyslexic.
-   **ADHD:** Often grouped with LDs. Trouble with Executive Function (focus, organization).

## Common Misconceptions
-   **They grow out of it:** No. It is lifelong. You just learn coping strategies.
-   **It's caused by bad parenting:** No. It is genetic and neurological.

## Related Concepts
-   **Neurodiversity:** The movement to view LDs as "differences" rather than "deficits."
-   **Response to Intervention (RTI):** The modern way schools identify LDs. Instead of waiting for the kid to fail, they intervene early and see if it helps.

## Applications
-   **Assistive Technology:** Text-to-speech software has revolutionized life for dyslexics.

## Criticism / Limitations
-   **Overdiagnosis:** Are we labeling normal childhood behavior (wiggling, daydreaming) as a disability just to sell drugs or get extra time on tests?
