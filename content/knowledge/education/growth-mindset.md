## Overview
"I'm just not a math person." "She's a natural genius." These are examples of a Fixed Mindset. The belief that talent is born, not made. Carol Dweck proved that this belief holds people back. A Growth Mindset is the belief that you can get smarter if you try.

## Core Idea
The core idea is **The Power of "Yet"**. "I can't do this... *yet*."

## Formal Definition
The belief that basic abilities can be developed through dedication and hard work.
Opposite: **Fixed Mindset** (abilities are static).

## Intuition
-   **Fixed Mindset:** Intelligence is a height. You are 6 feet tall. You can't change it. If you fail, it means you are short (dumb). So you avoid challenges to hide your shortness.
-   **Growth Mindset:** Intelligence is a muscle. You are weak. You can lift weights (study) to get strong. If you fail, it just means you need to lift more. So you embrace challenges.

## Examples
-   **Praise:**
    -   **Bad:** "You're so smart!" (Fixed. Implies it's a trait. If they fail next time, they think they aren't smart anymore).
    -   **Good:** "You worked really hard on that!" (Growth. Praises the process/effort).
-   **The Brain:** Neuroplasticity. The brain physically changes when you learn. Teaching kids this scientific fact improves their grades.

## Common Misconceptions
-   **It's just "Try Harder":** No. It's about trying *strategies*. If you bang your head against the wall, that's effort, but it's not growth. You need to try a new way.
-   **False Growth Mindset:** Teachers saying "Good job!" for everything. That's just participation trophies. You have to praise *effective* effort.

## Related Concepts
-   **Grit:** Passion and perseverance for long-term goals. (Angela Duckworth).
-   **Resilience:** Bouncing back from failure.

## Applications
-   **Business:** Companies like Microsoft use Growth Mindset to encourage employees to take risks and learn from mistakes.

## Criticism / Limitations
-   **Replication Crisis:** Some studies have failed to replicate Dweck's massive results. It might not be a magic bullet.
-   **Systemic Barriers:** Telling a poor kid "Just have a growth mindset!" ignores the fact that their school has no books.
