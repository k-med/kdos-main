  Project-based learning (PBL) is a student-centered pedagogy that involves a dynamic classroom approach in which it is believed that students acquire a deeper knowledge through active exploration of real-world challenges and problems.

## Overview
In the real world, you don't take tests. You do projects. You launch a website, plan an event, or build a product. Project-Based Learning (PBL) brings the real world into the classroom. Instead of listening to a lecture, students spend weeks solving a complex problem.

## Core Idea
The core idea is **Learning by Doing**. The project isn't the "dessert" at the end of the unit; it is the "main course." You learn the math *because* you need it to build the robot.

## Formal Definition
A teaching method in which students gain knowledge and skills by working for an extended period of time to investigate and respond to an authentic, engaging, and complex question, problem, or challenge.

## Intuition
-   **The Worksheet:** "Solve these 20 problems about area and perimeter." (Boring. Abstract).
-   **The Project:** "Design a Tiny House for a homeless person. You have a budget and size limit." (Engaging. Real). You still have to calculate area and perimeter, but now it matters.

## Examples
-   **High Tech High:** A famous charter school in San Diego where there are no exams, only projects. Students build boats, write books, and curate art exhibits.
-   **Civics:** Instead of reading about local government, students identify a problem in their town (e.g., a dangerous intersection) and lobby the city council to fix it.

## Common Misconceptions
-   **It's just "doing stuff":** It's not just arts and crafts. A good project must be rigorous. It must require mastering the academic standards to complete.
-   **It's unstructured:** It requires *more* structure than a lecture. The teacher has to manage 30 kids doing different things at once.

## Related Concepts
-   **21st Century Skills:** Collaboration, Communication, Critical Thinking, Creativity. (The "4 Cs"). PBL teaches these better than textbooks.
-   **Public Product:** The result is shown to the public (parents, experts), not just the teacher. This raises the stakes and quality.

## Applications
-   **STEM:** Engineering is naturally project-based.

## Criticism / Limitations
-   **Coverage:** It takes a long time. You can't "cover" as much material as a lecture. You go deep, not wide.
-   **Free Riders:** In group projects, the smart kid often does all the work.
