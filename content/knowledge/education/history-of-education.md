## Overview
From Plato's Academy to the one-room schoolhouse to Zoom university. The history of education tells the story of civilization.

## Core Idea
**Public Education (The Common School):** The radical idea that *everyone* (not just the rich) deserves a free education funded by taxes. Championed by Horace Mann in the US.

## Formal Definition (if applicable)
**Progressive Education:** A movement (led by John Dewey) that emphasized learning by doing, critical thinking, and democracy, rather than rote memorization and authoritarianism.

## Intuition
Schools reflect society.
- **Sparta:** Military training.
- **Middle Ages:** Religious training.
- **Industrial Revolution:** Factory training (bells, rows, schedules).
- **Information Age:** ??? (We are still figuring this out).

## Examples
- **Brown v. Board of Education (1954):** Ended legal segregation in US schools.
- **The GI Bill:** Sent millions of WWII veterans to college, creating the middle class.
- **Sputnik:** Launched the Space Race and a focus on science education.

## Common Misconceptions
- "Schools used to be better." (They were more exclusive. Graduation rates are higher now than ever.)
- "Summer vacation is for farming." (It was actually because rich city kids went to the country, and schools were too hot.)

## Related Concepts
- **Literacy Rates:** The rise of reading.
- **Women's Education:** The fight for access.
- **Colonial Education:** Imposing values on conquered peoples.

## Applications
- **Policy:** Understanding the roots of current problems.
- **Philosophy:** What is the purpose of school?
- **Sociology:** Education as a tool of social control or liberation.

## Criticism / Limitations
History is often written by the victors. The history of education often ignores indigenous ways of knowing.
