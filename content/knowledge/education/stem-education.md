## Overview
The future is robots, code, and climate change. To survive, we need kids who understand Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM). It's not just 4 subjects; it's a way of thinking. Solving problems with data and design.

## Core Idea
The core idea is **Integration**. In the real world, you don't do "Math" for an hour and then "Science." You use Math *to do* Science. STEM blends them together.

## Formal Definition
An interdisciplinary approach to learning where rigorous academic concepts are coupled with real-world lessons.
**STEAM:** Adding **A**rts to the mix (Creativity + Logic).

## Intuition
-   **The Silo:** Math class teaches formulas. Science class teaches facts.
-   **The Bridge:** STEM class asks: "Build a bridge that can hold 50lbs." You need Math (geometry), Science (physics), and Engineering (design) to do it.

## Examples
-   **Robotics Club:** The ultimate STEM activity. Coding, wiring, building, and competing.
-   **Maker Movement:** Kids using 3D printers and laser cutters to invent things.
-   **Girls Who Code:** Programs designed to close the gender gap in tech.

## Common Misconceptions
-   **It's just for geniuses:** STEM is for everyone. Understanding data is a basic life skill now (Data Literacy).
-   **It kills the Humanities:** Some fear that focusing on STEM means we stop teaching History and Literature. (Hence the push for STEAM).

## Related Concepts
-   **Project-Based Learning:** The best way to teach STEM.
-   **Computational Thinking:** Thinking like a computer. Breaking big problems into small steps (Algorithms).

## Applications
-   **Workforce:** There are millions of unfilled STEM jobs. We need engineers more than we need poets (economically speaking).

## Criticism / Limitations
-   **Technocracy:** The belief that technology can solve every human problem. Sometimes we need Ethics (Philosophy) more than Code.
