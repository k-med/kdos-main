## Overview
Teaching is one of the most stressful jobs in the world. You are on stage for 6 hours a day, managing 30 energetic/difficult humans, with low pay and high pressure from parents and principals. 50% of new teachers quit within the first 5 years. This is the Burnout Crisis.

## Core Idea
The core idea is **Emotional Labor**. Teachers don't just teach math; they manage emotions. They comfort crying kids, break up fights, and absorb the trauma of their students. This drains the battery.

## Formal Definition
A state of physical, emotional, and mental exhaustion caused by long-term involvement in emotionally demanding situations.
Symptoms: **Exhaustion**, **Cynicism**, **Inefficacy**.

## Intuition
-   **The Candle:** You can't light another candle if your own flame has gone out. Teachers are expected to set themselves on fire to keep others warm. Eventually, they turn to ash.

## Examples
-   **The "Hero Teacher" Myth:** Movies like *Freedom Writers* show teachers working 18 hours a day, buying books with their own money, and saving every kid. This sets an impossible standard. If you aren't a martyr, you feel like a failure.
-   **Standardized Testing:** The pressure to raise scores adds massive stress. Teachers feel like they are teaching robots, not kids.

## Common Misconceptions
-   **They have summers off:** Most teachers spend summer planning, grading, or working a second job to pay the bills.
-   **It's just "stress":** Burnout is different. Stress is "too much" (too much work). Burnout is "not enough" (not enough hope, not enough meaning).

## Related Concepts
-   **Compassion Fatigue:** The cost of caring. When you care too much for too long, you go numb.
-   **Self-Care:** The proposed solution (Yoga, Meditation). But critics say: "You can't yoga your way out of a broken system."

## Applications
-   **Retention:** Schools are trying to fix burnout by offering better pay, smaller classes, and more respect.

## Criticism / Limitations
-   **Systemic Issue:** Burnout isn't an individual failure; it's a workplace hazard.
