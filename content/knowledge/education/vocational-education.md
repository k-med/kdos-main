## Overview
Not everyone needs to go to college to study Shakespeare. Some people need to learn how to fix a car, weld a pipe, or code a website. Vocational Education (CTE) is about learning a specific trade. It is the bridge between school and work.

## Core Idea
The core idea is **Employability**. The goal is not "well-roundedness"; the goal is a job.

## Formal Definition
Education that prepares people to work in a trade, a craft, as a technician, or in support roles in professions such as engineering, accountancy, nursing, medicine, architecture, or law.

## Intuition
-   **The Pipeline:**
    -   **Academic:** High School -> College -> Grad School -> Professor. (The path for 10% of people).
    -   **Vocational:** High School -> Apprenticeship -> Master Plumber. (The path for the other 90%).

## Examples
-   **Germany:** The gold standard. They have a "Dual System" where students spend 3 days at work (Apprenticeship) and 2 days at school. Youth unemployment is very low.
-   **Coding Bootcamps:** Modern vocational schools. Learn to code in 3 months and get a job at Google. No degree required.

## Common Misconceptions
-   **It's for "dumb" kids:** This is a terrible stigma. Being a master electrician requires complex math and problem-solving. It is just a different *kind* of intelligence.
-   **It's a dead end:** Skilled tradespeople often earn more than college graduates (and have zero debt).

## Related Concepts
-   **Skills Gap:** Employers say they can't find workers with the right skills (welding, coding), even though millions are unemployed. Vocational ed fixes this.
-   **Blue Collar vs. White Collar:** The line is blurring. "New Collar" jobs (Cybersecurity) are vocational but high-tech.

## Applications
-   **Economic Growth:** A country needs plumbers just as much as it needs philosophers. Maybe more.

## Criticism / Limitations
-   **Tracking:** Historically, poor and minority students were forced into vocational tracks while rich kids went to college prep. This created a segregated system.
