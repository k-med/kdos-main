## Overview
School isn't neutral. It teaches you to obey authority, to be a good worker, and to accept the world as it is. Critical Pedagogy says: "Wake up." Education should be about freedom. It should teach you to question power and change the world.

## Core Idea
The core idea is **Consciousness Raising (Conscientização)**. Learning to perceive social, political, and economic contradictions, and to take action against the oppressive elements of reality.

## Formal Definition
A philosophy of education that insists that issues of social justice and democracy are not distinct from acts of teaching and learning.
Founder: **Paulo Freire**.

## Intuition
-   **Banking Model:** The teacher deposits knowledge into the student's empty head. The student is passive. (Oppressive).
-   **Problem-Posing Model:** The teacher and student learn together. They look at a problem in their lives (e.g., "Why is our water dirty?") and solve it. (Liberating).

## Examples
-   **Literacy in Brazil:** Freire taught poor farmers to read by using words that mattered to them ("Land," "Wages," "Rights"). They learned to read the *word* and the *world* at the same time.
-   **Student Activism:** Students protesting climate change or gun violence. They are applying critical pedagogy.

## Common Misconceptions
-   **It's Marxist propaganda:** It is influenced by Marx, but it's not about brainwashing. It's about *critical thinking*. Questioning everything, even the teacher.

## Related Concepts
-   **Hidden Curriculum:** The unwritten rules school teaches you (be on time, sit still, don't talk back).
-   **Praxis:** Reflection + Action. You can't just think about justice; you have to do it.

## Applications
-   **Social Justice Education:** Teaching history from the perspective of the oppressed, not just the conquerors.

## Criticism / Limitations
-   **Too Political:** Some parents say: "Just teach my kid math. Don't teach them to be a revolutionary."
