  Learning theories are conceptual frameworks describing how information is absorbed, processed, and retained during learning. Cognitive, emotional, and environmental influences, as well as prior experience, all play a part.

## Overview
How do we learn? Is it by reward and punishment (Pavlov's dog)? Or by building our own understanding (Lego)? Different theories offer different answers.

## Core Idea
**Constructivism:** Learners don't just passively receive information; they actively *construct* knowledge based on their experiences. You can't just pour knowledge into a student's head like water into a bucket.

## Formal Definition (if applicable)
**Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD):** The difference between what a learner can do without help and what they can do with help. Teaching should happen in this "sweet spot" (Vygotsky).

## Intuition
- **Behaviorism:** Training a dog. Sit -> Treat. (Drill and kill).
- **Cognitivism:** Computer processing. Input -> Process -> Output. (Memory strategies).
- **Constructivism:** A science experiment. Trying things out and seeing what happens.

## Examples
- **Scaffolding:** Giving a student a lot of help at first, then slowly taking it away (like training wheels).
- **Social Learning:** Watching a YouTube video to learn how to fix a sink (Bandura).

## Common Misconceptions
- "Learning Styles (Visual, Auditory, Kinesthetic) are real." (Research shows this is a myth. Good teaching uses all modes.)
- "You either get it or you don't." (Growth Mindset: Intelligence can be developed.)

## Related Concepts
- **Metacognition:** Thinking about thinking.
- **Andragogy:** The art of teaching adults (vs. Pedagogy for children).
- **Bloom's Taxonomy:** A hierarchy of learning objectives (Remember -> Understand -> Apply -> Analyze -> Evaluate -> Create).

## Applications
- **Classroom Management:** Using rewards (Behaviorism).
- **Lesson Planning:** Designing hands-on activities (Constructivism).
- **EdTech:** Adaptive learning software.

## Criticism / Limitations
Behaviorism ignores internal mental states. Constructivism can be inefficient for beginners who need direct instruction.
