  Andragogy refers to methods and principles used in adult education. The word comes from the Greek Greek ἀνήρ (anēr, meaning "man") and ἀγωγός (agōgos, meaning "leader of"). Therefore, andragogy literally means "leading man", whereas "pedagogy" literally means "leading children".

## Overview
Teaching a 40-year-old is different from teaching a 4-year-old. Kids learn because they have to. Adults learn because they *want* to. Andragogy is the science of teaching adults.

## Core Idea
The core idea is **Self-Direction**. Adults are independent. They resent being treated like children. They want to know *why* they are learning something and how it will help them solve a real problem.

## Formal Definition
The method and practice of teaching adult learners.
Coined by **Malcolm Knowles**.
Contrasted with **Pedagogy** (teaching children).

## Intuition
-   **Pedagogy:** "Open your book to page 10 because I said so." (Subject-centered).
-   **Andragogy:** "I need to learn Excel because my boss wants this report by Friday." (Problem-centered).

## Examples
-   **Corporate Training:** You don't lecture employees. You give them a workshop where they solve a real business problem.
-   **Duolingo:** Adults learning a language for a trip. They are motivated by the goal (ordering beer in Spain), not by a grade.

## Common Misconceptions
-   **Adults can't learn:** "You can't teach an old dog new tricks." False. Neuroplasticity exists until death. Adults just learn *differently* (slower processing, but more context).

## Related Concepts
-   **Transformative Learning:** Learning that changes your worldview. (e.g., An adult realizing their political beliefs were wrong).
-   **Experiential Learning:** Learning by doing. Adults have a lifetime of experience to draw from.

## Applications
-   **Medical School:** Moving from lectures to "Problem-Based Learning" (diagnosing a fake patient).

## Criticism / Limitations
-   **Structure:** Sometimes adults *do* need structure. If you are learning Brain Surgery, you don't want "self-direction." You want a strict curriculum.
