## Overview
The best way to learn something is to teach it. Peer Learning flips the script. Instead of the teacher being the "Sage on the Stage," students teach each other. It turns the classroom from a hierarchy into a network.

## Core Idea
The core idea is **Social Construction of Knowledge**. We learn better when we talk, argue, and explain things to friends.

## Formal Definition
An educational practice in which students interact with other students to attain educational goals.
**Peer Instruction (Mazur):** A specific method where students vote on an answer, then discuss it with their neighbor, then vote again.

## Intuition
-   **The Translator:** Sometimes the teacher explains it perfectly, but you don't get it. Then your friend leans over and says, "It's just like Minecraft," and suddenly you get it. Peers speak the same language.

## Examples
-   **Study Groups:** The classic form.
-   **Jigsaw Classroom:** You divide a topic (WWII) into 4 parts. Each student becomes an expert on one part, then teaches it to their group. Everyone *has* to participate.
-   **Code Review:** In programming, developers check each other's code. It's peer learning in the workplace.

## Common Misconceptions
-   **It's the blind leading the blind:** If neither student knows the answer, they can reinforce wrong ideas. That's why the teacher must monitor the groups.
-   **Smart kids do all the work:** This is a risk. Good peer learning requires structure so everyone contributes.

## Related Concepts
-   **Vygotsky's ZPD:** Peers can act as the "More Knowledgeable Other" to help you reach the next level.
-   **Soft Skills:** It teaches teamwork, communication, and patience.

## Applications
-   **Large Classes:** In a lecture hall of 500 students, the professor can't talk to everyone. Peer instruction makes the class feel small.

## Criticism / Limitations
-   **Introverts:** Some students hate group work. They learn better alone. Forcing them to "collaborate" constantly creates anxiety.
