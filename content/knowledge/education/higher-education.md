## Overview
Universities are the engines of knowledge. They teach the next generation of leaders and conduct the research that changes the world. But they are also facing a crisis of cost and relevance.

## Core Idea
**Academic Freedom:** The liberty to teach, study, and pursue knowledge without unreasonable interference or restriction from law, institutional regulations, or public pressure.

## Formal Definition (if applicable)
**Tenure:** A permanent job contract granted to a professor after a probationary period. It protects academic freedom (so you can't be fired for controversial research).

## Intuition
It's the Ivory Tower. A place apart from the "real world" where deep thinking happens. But the walls are crumbling as tuition rises and the internet offers free knowledge.

## Examples
- **Liberal Arts:** Broad education (history, philosophy, science) to make you a well-rounded citizen.
- **Vocational Training:** Specific skills for a specific job (nursing, welding).
- **Ivy League:** Elite, private universities in the US.

## Common Misconceptions
- "College is just for job training." (Historically, it was for character formation and citizenship.)
- "Professors only teach." (At research universities, their main job is research; teaching is secondary.)

## Related Concepts
- **Adjunctification:** The shift from full-time professors to part-time, low-paid adjuncts.
- **Grade Inflation:** The tendency for grades to go up over time.
- **Affirmative Action:** Policies to increase diversity.

## Applications
- **Research:** Developing vaccines, AI, and policy.
- **Social Mobility:** College is still the surest path to the middle class.
- **Economy:** Universities as hubs of innovation (Silicon Valley grew out of Stanford).

## Criticism / Limitations
Skyrocketing tuition and student debt. The "reproducibility crisis" in research. Political polarization on campus.
