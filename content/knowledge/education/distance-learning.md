## Overview
It used to be "Correspondence School"—they mailed you a book, you mailed back the test. Now it is Zoom University. Distance Learning breaks the link between *where* you are and *what* you learn. You can learn AI from Stanford while sitting in a village in Kenya.

## Core Idea
The core idea is **Access**. Removing the barriers of geography and time.

## Formal Definition
The education of students who may not always be physically present at a school.
**Synchronous:** Live (Zoom).
**Asynchronous:** Recorded (YouTube).

## Intuition
-   **The Lecture Hall:** Limited seats. Expensive. You have to be there at 9:00 AM.
-   **The Internet:** Infinite seats. Cheap (or free). You can watch it at 2:00 AM in your pajamas.

## Examples
-   **MOOCs (Massive Open Online Courses):** Coursera, edX. Classes with 100,000 students.
-   **Khan Academy:** One guy in a closet teaching math to the world.
-   **COVID-19:** The Great Experiment. The whole world went to distance learning overnight. It showed us the potential (flexibility) and the limits (loneliness).

## Common Misconceptions
-   **It's easier:** It's actually harder. You need more self-discipline. There is no teacher standing over you to make you do the work. Dropout rates are very high (90% for MOOCs).

## Related Concepts
-   **Blended Learning:** The best of both worlds. Watch the lecture online at home, come to class to do the homework and ask questions. (Flipped Classroom).
-   **Digital Divide:** Distance learning is great... if you have high-speed internet. If you don't, you are left behind.

## Applications
-   **Corporate Training:** Companies use it to train employees cheaply.
-   **Lifelong Learning:** Adults learning new skills after work.

## Criticism / Limitations
-   **Socialization:** School is also about making friends and learning social skills. You can't do that on Zoom.
-   **Cheating:** It's much easier to cheat online.
