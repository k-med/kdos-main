## Overview
"Is it on the test?" Assessment drives learning. If you measure it, it matters. But measuring the mind is harder than measuring a table.

## Core Idea
**Formative vs. Summative:**
- **Formative:** Assessment *for* learning. (The chef tasting the soup). Low stakes, feedback-oriented.
- **Summative:** Assessment *of* learning. (The guest tasting the soup). High stakes, final grade.

## Formal Definition (if applicable)
**Validity:** Does the test measure what it's supposed to measure?
**Reliability:** Does the test give consistent results?

## Intuition
A thermometer is reliable (it always says 98.6) but if you stick it in a roast chicken to see if it's done, it's not valid (wrong tool).

## Examples
- **Standardized Tests:** SAT, GRE, PISA.
- **Rubric:** A scoring guide used to evaluate the quality of students' constructed responses (e.g., essays).
- **Portfolio:** A collection of student work over time.

## Common Misconceptions
- "Tests are objective." (They can be culturally biased.)
- "More testing = better schools." (Campbell's Law: The more any quantitative social indicator is used for social decision-making, the more subject it will be to corruption pressures and the more apt it will be to distort and corrupt the social processes it is intended to monitor.)

## Related Concepts
- **Norm-Referenced:** Comparing you to others (Bell curve).
- **Criterion-Referenced:** Comparing you to a standard (Driver's license test).
- **Psychometrics:** The science of measuring mental capacities.

## Applications
- **Admissions:** Who gets into college?
- **Accountability:** Which schools get funding?
- **Diagnosis:** Does this child have a learning disability?

## Criticism / Limitations
"Teaching to the test" narrows the curriculum. High-stakes testing causes anxiety.
