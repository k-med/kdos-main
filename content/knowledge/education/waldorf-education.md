## Overview
In Silicon Valley, the tech executives send their kids to Waldorf schools where computers are banned until high school. Why? Because Waldorf focuses on creativity, imagination, and hands-on work (knitting, gardening, painting). They believe you need to build the human *before* you plug them into the machine.

## Core Idea
The core idea is **Head, Heart, and Hands**. Education should not just be about the brain (Head). It must also engage the emotions (Heart) and the body (Hands).

## Formal Definition
A holistic educational approach based on the philosophy of Rudolf Steiner (Anthroposophy).
Stages: **0-7 (Will/Doing)**, **7-14 (Feeling/Imagination)**, **14-21 (Thinking/Intellect)**.

## Intuition
-   **Slow Education:** Most schools rush to teach reading at age 4. Waldorf waits until age 7. They believe rushing kills the joy of learning. It's like slow food vs. fast food.

## Examples
-   **Eurythmy:** A form of movement/dance taught in Waldorf schools to help children express language and music with their bodies.
-   **Main Lesson:** Instead of 45-minute periods, they spend 2 hours every morning on one subject (e.g., Norse Mythology) for 3 weeks. Deep immersion.

## Common Misconceptions
-   **It's a cult:** It is based on Steiner's weird spiritual philosophy (Anthroposophy), which includes beliefs in karma and gnomes. However, most Waldorf schools downplay the spiritual stuff and focus on the pedagogy.
-   **They don't learn to read:** They learn later, but they catch up quickly. By age 10, they are usually ahead of public school kids.

## Related Concepts
-   **Holistic Education:** Seeing the child as a whole being (soul, body, mind), not just a test score.
-   **Low-Tech:** The belief that screens atrophy the imagination.

## Applications
-   **Creativity:** Waldorf graduates are overrepresented in the arts and innovation sectors because they spent their childhood imagining, not consuming.

## Criticism / Limitations
-   **Science:** Steiner had some unscientific ideas (e.g., about evolution and medicine). Some Waldorf schools have low vaccination rates.
