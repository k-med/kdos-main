## Overview
Why do we have schools? Is it to make good workers? Good citizens? Or happy humans? The Philosophy of Education asks the big questions. If you don't know the *why*, the *how* doesn't matter.

## Core Idea
The core idea is **Purpose**. Every educational system is built on a philosophy, even if it's hidden.
-   **Sparta:** Purpose = Produce soldiers.
-   **Athens:** Purpose = Produce thinkers.
-   **USA:** Purpose = Produce... workers? Voters? Consumers? We are confused.

## Formal Definition
The branch of applied philosophy that investigates the nature of education as well as its aims and problems.
Key Figures: **Plato**, **Rousseau**, **Dewey**.

## Intuition
-   **The Garden vs. The Factory:**
    -   **Rousseau (Naturalism):** The child is a seed. Let it grow wild and free.
    -   **Locke (Tabula Rasa):** The child is a blank slate. Write knowledge upon it.

## Examples
-   **Perennialism:** The goal is to teach the "Great Books" (Plato, Shakespeare) because truth is eternal. (St. John's College).
-   **Progressivism (Dewey):** The goal is to teach students how to live in a democracy. Education is life itself, not preparation for life.
-   **Essentialism:** The goal is to teach the basics (Reading, Writing, Math) efficiently.

## Common Misconceptions
-   **It's useless theory:** Every time a teacher decides whether to give a test or do a project, they are making a philosophical decision about what matters.

## Related Concepts
-   **Epistemology:** How do we know what we know? (If knowledge is objective facts, we lecture. If knowledge is subjective construction, we discuss).
-   **Ethics:** Is it ethical to force a child to learn something they hate?

## Applications
-   **Curriculum Design:** Deciding what to teach. Why do we teach Calculus but not Cooking? That's a philosophical choice about what is "important."

## Criticism / Limitations
-   **Too Abstract:** Philosophers argue about "The Good Life" while teachers are trying to get 30 kids to sit down.

## Further Reading
-   Dewey, John. *Democracy and Education*.
-   Plato. *The Republic*.
