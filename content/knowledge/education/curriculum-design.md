## Overview
It's the roadmap. Without a curriculum, a teacher is just a person talking in a room. A good curriculum ensures that students learn the right things in the right order.

## Core Idea
**Backward Design:** Start with the end in mind.
1.  Identify desired results (What should they know?).
2.  Determine acceptable evidence (How will I know they know it?).
3.  Plan learning experiences (How will I teach it?).

## Formal Definition (if applicable)
**Alignment:** The degree to which the learning objectives, assessments, and instructional activities match. If you test on B but taught A, you have poor alignment.

## Intuition
Planning a trip.
1.  Destination: Paris (Objective).
2.  Evidence: Photos of the Eiffel Tower (Assessment).
3.  Plan: Buy tickets, pack bags (Instruction).

## Examples
- **Spiral Curriculum:** Revisiting the same topics at increasing levels of complexity over time (Bruner).
- **Project-Based Learning (PBL):** Learning by doing a big project.
- **Common Core:** A set of national standards in the US.

## Common Misconceptions
- "Curriculum is just the textbook." (The textbook is a tool; the curriculum is the plan.)
- "Coverage is king." (Teaching everything shallowly is worse than teaching a few things deeply.)

## Related Concepts
- **Scope and Sequence:** What is taught (scope) and in what order (sequence).
- **Hidden Curriculum:** The unwritten rules and values students learn (e.g., punctuality, obedience).
- **Differentiation:** Tailoring instruction to meet individual needs.

## Applications
- **School Districts:** Creating pacing guides.
- **Corporate Training:** Onboarding new employees.
- **Online Courses:** Designing a Coursera class.

## Criticism / Limitations
Standardized curricula can stifle teacher creativity and ignore local needs.
