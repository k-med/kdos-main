## Overview
Great teachers aren't born; they're made. Teacher education is about turning a subject expert (who knows math) into a teacher (who can *teach* math to a room of 13-year-olds).

## Core Idea
**Pedagogical Content Knowledge (PCK):** It's not enough to know the subject (Content Knowledge) or how to teach (Pedagogical Knowledge). You need to know how to teach *that specific subject*. (e.g., Knowing the common mistakes students make when learning fractions).

## Formal Definition (if applicable)
**Reflective Practice:** The ability to reflect on one's actions so as to engage in a process of continuous learning. "What went well? What went wrong? How will I fix it tomorrow?"

## Intuition
Teaching is like performing live theater, 5 hours a day, with a hostile audience that didn't buy tickets. You need training.

## Examples
- **Student Teaching:** An internship where a future teacher takes over a classroom under supervision.
- **Alternative Certification:** Fast-track programs for career changers (e.g., Teach For America).
- **Professional Development (PD):** Workshops for current teachers.

## Common Misconceptions
- "Those who can, do; those who can't, teach." (Teaching is harder than doing. You have to understand it deeply enough to explain it to a novice.)
- "It's just common sense." (Classroom management is a complex skill.)

## Related Concepts
- **Tenure:** Job security.
- **Burnout:** High rates of teachers leaving the profession.
- **Mentoring:** Experienced teachers helping new ones.

## Applications
- **University Programs:** Schools of Education.
- **Licensure:** State exams (Praxis).
- **School Leadership:** Principals supporting teachers.

## Criticism / Limitations
Teacher prep programs are often criticized for being too theoretical and disconnected from the reality of the classroom.
