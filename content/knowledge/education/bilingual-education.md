## Overview
In the US, we often think of bilingualism as a problem to be fixed ("He doesn't speak English"). In the rest of the world, it's a superpower. Bilingual Education is teaching students in two languages so they become fluent in both. It's not just about words; it's about brain power.

## Core Idea
The core idea is **Cognitive Advantage**. Speaking two languages rewires your brain. It improves executive function, focus, and multitasking.

## Formal Definition
Teaching academic content in two languages.
**Dual Language Immersion:** A class where 50% of students are English speakers and 50% are Spanish speakers. They teach each other.

## Intuition
-   **The Gym:** Learning a second language is like lifting weights for your brain. It makes the brain stronger and more flexible.
-   **The Lens:** Each language is a different lens for seeing the world. Speaking two languages gives you 3D vision.

## Examples
-   **Canada:** French Immersion is huge. English-speaking kids go to school entirely in French.
-   **ESL (English as a Second Language):** The old model. Pulling kids out of class to learn English. It often stigmatizes them.
-   **Translanguaging:** Allowing students to mix languages in class to help them understand complex ideas.

## Common Misconceptions
-   **It confuses kids:** "If you speak Spanish at home, they won't learn English." False. Kids are sponges. They can easily handle two languages. In fact, knowing one language well helps you learn the second one.

## Related Concepts
-   **Heritage Language:** The language spoken by a student's family. Keeping it alive is important for their identity.
-   **Critical Period:** The window (before puberty) when it is easiest to learn a language without an accent.

## Applications
-   **Global Economy:** In a globalized world, speaking only English is a disadvantage.

## Criticism / Limitations
-   **Politics:** In the US, bilingual education is often attacked by "English Only" movements who see it as a threat to national unity.
