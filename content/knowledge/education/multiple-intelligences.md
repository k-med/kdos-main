## Overview
We used to think you were either "Smart" (high IQ) or "Dumb" (low IQ). Howard Gardner said: "That's too simple." You might be bad at math but a genius at music. Or bad at writing but a genius at understanding people. He proposed 8 different types of intelligence.

## Core Idea
The core idea is **Pluralism**. There isn't one way to be smart.
The 8 Types:
1.  **Linguistic:** Word smart (Poet).
2.  **Logical-Mathematical:** Number smart (Scientist).
3.  **Spatial:** Picture smart (Architect).
4.  **Bodily-Kinesthetic:** Body smart (Athlete).
5.  **Musical:** Music smart (Composer).
6.  **Interpersonal:** People smart (Politician).
7.  **Intrapersonal:** Self smart (Philosopher).
8.  **Naturalist:** Nature smart (Biologist).

## Formal Definition
A theory proposing the differentiation of human intelligence into specific modalities.
Proposed by **Howard Gardner** in 1983.

## Intuition
-   **The Computer:** IQ thinks the brain is a single computer. If the processor is fast, you are smart at everything.
-   **The App Store:** Multiple Intelligences thinks the brain has different apps. You might have a great Music App but a buggy Math App.

## Examples
-   **Michael Jordan:** He might not win a Nobel Prize in Physics, but his Bodily-Kinesthetic intelligence is off the charts. Is he "dumb"? No.
-   **School:** Traditional school only values the first two (Linguistic and Logical). It ignores the other 6. This makes many smart kids feel stupid.

## Common Misconceptions
-   **It's the same as Learning Styles:** No. "Learning Styles" (Visual/Auditory) is a myth. Multiple Intelligences is about *ability*, not just how you like to learn.
-   **Everyone is a genius:** No. You can be bad at all 8. It just broadens the definition of potential.

## Related Concepts
-   **g factor:** The opposing theory. The idea that there *is* a general intelligence that correlates across all tasks. (Psychologists mostly support *g*, Educators love Multiple Intelligences).

## Applications
-   **Differentiation:** Teachers trying to teach a lesson in 8 different ways to reach every kid.

## Criticism / Limitations
-   **Lack of Evidence:** There is very little scientific evidence that these 8 categories exist in the brain. Critics say Gardner just redefined "Talents" as "Intelligences" to make people feel better.
