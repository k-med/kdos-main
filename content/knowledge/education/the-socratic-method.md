## Overview
Socrates was the most annoying man in Athens. He didn't give speeches; he just asked questions. "What is Justice?" "What is Courage?" He forced people to examine their own beliefs until they realized they knew nothing. This method—teaching by asking—is the foundation of Western education.

## Core Idea
The core idea is **The Midwife**. Socrates said he was a midwife for ideas. He didn't give birth to the idea; he just helped the student deliver it. The truth is already inside you; you just need help finding it.

## Formal Definition
A form of cooperative argumentative dialogue based on asking and answering questions to stimulate critical thinking.
**Elenchus:** The process of cross-examination to reveal contradictions.

## Intuition
-   **The Lecture:** "The Earth is round." (Passive).
-   **Socratic:** "What shape is the shadow of the Earth on the Moon?" "Round." "What object casts a round shadow?" "A sphere." "So what shape is the Earth?" "A sphere." (Active).

## Examples
-   **Law School:** The professor calls on a student and grills them on a case. "Why did the court rule that way?" "What if the facts were different?" It teaches lawyers to think on their feet.
-   **Therapy (CBT):** Therapists use Socratic questioning to help patients challenge their negative thoughts. "Is it *really* true that everyone hates you? What is the evidence?"

## Common Misconceptions
-   **It's just asking questions:** It's asking *guided* questions. The teacher knows the destination but lets the student drive the car.

## Related Concepts
-   **Dialectic:** The clash of opposing ideas (Thesis vs. Antithesis) that leads to the truth (Synthesis).
-   **Intellectual Humility:** Admitting "I know that I know nothing."

## Applications
-   **Critical Thinking:** It is the best way to teach people *how* to think, not just *what* to think.

## Criticism / Limitations
-   **Humiliation:** In the wrong hands (like a mean law professor), it can be used to shame students rather than teach them. (The "Paper Chase" effect).

## Further Reading
-   Plato. *The Dialogues* (especially *Meno* and *Apology*).
