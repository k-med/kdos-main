  Constructivism is a theory in education which posits that individuals or learners do not acquire knowledge and understanding by passively perceiving it within a direct process of knowledge transmission, rather they construct new understandings and knowledge through experience and social discourse.

## Overview
You can't just "download" knowledge into a student's brain like a file. They have to build it themselves. Constructivism says that learning is an active process of building (constructing) meaning from experience.

## Core Idea
The core idea is **Active Building**. Knowledge isn't a thing you *get*; it's a thing you *make*.

## Formal Definition
A theory of learning that argues that humans construct knowledge and meaning from their experiences.
Key Figures: **Jean Piaget** (Cognitive Constructivism) and **Lev Vygotsky** (Social Constructivism).

## Intuition
-   **Lego:** You can give a kid a finished Lego castle (Traditional Teaching). Or you can give them the bricks and let them build it (Constructivism). They understand the castle better if they built it.
-   **The Map:** You don't learn a city by looking at a map. You learn it by getting lost and finding your way back.

## Examples
-   **Math:** Instead of memorizing $3 \times 4 = 12$, the student arranges 3 rows of 4 buttons and counts them. They "discover" multiplication.
-   **Science:** Doing an experiment to see *why* oil floats on water, rather than reading about density in a textbook.

## Common Misconceptions
-   **The teacher does nothing:** No, the teacher is the "Facilitator." They guide the student.
-   **There is no truth:** Radical Constructivism says reality is subjective. But most educators just mean that *learning* is subjective.

## Related Concepts
-   **Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD):** The sweet spot. Things the student can't do alone, but *can* do with help. (Vygotsky).
-   **Scaffolding:** The support the teacher gives (hints, clues) to help the student climb to the next level.

## Applications
-   **Inquiry-Based Learning:** Starting with a question ("Why is the sky blue?") and letting students research the answer.

## Criticism / Limitations
-   **Efficiency:** It takes a long time to "discover" everything. Sometimes it's faster to just tell the student the answer (Direct Instruction). You don't want a medical student to "construct" their own theory of surgery.
