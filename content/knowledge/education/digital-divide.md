## Overview
The internet is the new library. If you don't have access, you are locked out of the modern world. The Digital Divide is the gap between the "Information Haves" and the "Information Have-Nots." It is the new face of inequality.

## Core Idea
The core idea is **Access as a Right**. In the 21st century, the internet is not a luxury; it is a utility, like water or electricity.

## Formal Definition
The gap between demographics and regions that have access to modern information and communications technology, and those that don't.
Levels: **Access** (Hardware), **Connectivity** (Internet), **Skills** (Literacy).

## Intuition
-   **The Homework Gap:** Teacher assigns homework online.
    -   Rich Kid: Does it on a MacBook Pro with fiber internet.
    -   Poor Kid: Sits in the McDonald's parking lot to use the free WiFi on a cracked phone.
    -   Result: The poor kid fails, not because they are dumb, but because they are disconnected.

## Examples
-   **Rural Broadband:** Farmers in Nebraska often have worse internet than people in Nairobi. It kills rural economies.
-   **COVID-19:** Exposed the divide brutally. When schools went remote, millions of kids simply disappeared because they had no connection.

## Common Misconceptions
-   **It's just about buying laptops:** Giving a kid a laptop doesn't help if they don't know how to use it (Digital Literacy) or if the software is only in English.

## Related Concepts
-   **Net Neutrality:** The principle that all internet traffic should be treated equally. Without it, ISPs could charge extra for "fast lanes," hurting the poor even more.
-   **Leapfrogging:** Developing countries skipping landlines and going straight to mobile phones.

## Applications
-   **One Laptop Per Child (OLPC):** A famous failure. They dropped laptops on villages without training or support. Most broke or were sold.

## Criticism / Limitations
-   **Techno-Optimism:** Giving everyone internet won't solve poverty. It might just distract them with TikTok.
