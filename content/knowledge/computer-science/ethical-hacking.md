## Overview
To catch a thief, you have to think like a thief. Ethical Hacking (White Hat) is the practice of breaking into computers *with permission* to find the holes before the bad guys (Black Hat) do. It is the immune system of the internet.

## Core Idea
The core idea is **Penetration Testing (Pen Testing)**. Simulating a cyberattack. The company hires you to hack them. If you get in, you write a report telling them how you did it, so they can fix it.

## Formal Definition
An authorized attempt to gain unauthorized access to a computer system, application, or data.
**CIA Triad:** The goal of security. **C**onfidentiality, **I**ntegrity, **A**vailability.

## Intuition
-   **Security Guard:** Checks the locks every night.
-   **Ethical Hacker:** Tries to pick the lock, smash the window, and bribe the receptionist. If they succeed, they leave a note saying "Fix this window."

## Examples
-   **SQL Injection:** The most common hack. Typing code into a login box (`' OR 1=1 --`) to trick the database into letting you in without a password.
-   **Phishing:** Sending a fake email ("Reset your password") to steal credentials. 90% of hacks start with a human error, not a code bug.
-   **Bug Bounties:** Companies like Google and Facebook pay millions of dollars to anyone who finds a bug in their code. It's crowd-sourced security.

## Common Misconceptions
-   **Hackers are geniuses:** Most hackers are "Script Kiddies" who just download tools that other people wrote. Real exploits are rare.
-   **It's illegal:** It is legal *if you have permission*. Hacking without permission is a felony, even if you had good intentions (Grey Hat).

## Related Concepts
-   **Social Engineering:** Hacking people, not computers. Calling the help desk and pretending to be the CEO to get a password reset.
-   **Zero Day:** A vulnerability that the software maker doesn't know about yet. It is worth a fortune on the black market.

## Applications
-   **Red Teaming:** A full-scale war game. The Red Team attacks (physically and digitally), and the Blue Team defends.

## Criticism / Limitations
-   **The Arms Race:** Defenders have to be right 100% of the time. Attackers only have to be right once. The odds are always stacked against defense.
