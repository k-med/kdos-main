## Overview
**Algorithms** are the recipes of the digital world. They are step-by-step instructions for solving a problem. From Google Search to your GPS, algorithms run modern life.

## Core Idea
The core idea is **Efficiency**. How do we solve a problem using the least amount of time and memory?

## Formal Definition
A finite sequence of well-defined, computer-implementable instructions, typically to solve a class of problems or to perform a computation.

## Intuition
-   **The Recipe:** To bake a cake, you follow steps: Mix flour, add eggs, bake at 350. That's an algorithm.
-   **Sorting Cards:** How do you sort a deck of cards?
    -   *Bubble Sort:* Compare two, swap if wrong. Repeat forever. (Slow).
    -   *Merge Sort:* Split deck in half, sort halves, merge. (Fast).

## Examples
-   **PageRank:** The algorithm that made Google. It ranks web pages by how many other pages link to them.
-   **Dijkstra's Algorithm:** Finding the shortest path on a map (GPS).
-   **RSA:** The algorithm that secures the internet (Cryptography).

## Common Misconceptions
-   **Misconception:** Algorithms are unbiased.
    -   **Correction:** Algorithms are written by humans and trained on human data. They can inherit and amplify **Bias** (e.g., facial recognition working poorly on minorities).
-   **Misconception:** It's "magic."
    -   **Correction:** It's just math. Input -> Logic -> Output.

-   **[Big O Notation](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/computer-science/big-o.md):** How we measure algorithm speed.

## Applications
-   **Finance:** High-frequency trading.
-   **Biology:** DNA sequencing.
-   **Social Media:** The "Feed" algorithm that decides what you see.

## Criticism and Limitations
-   **Black Box:** Deep Learning algorithms are often uninterpretable. We know *that* they work, but not *how*.
