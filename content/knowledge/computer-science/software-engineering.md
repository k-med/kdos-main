## Overview
Programming is writing code. Software engineering is building products. It involves teamwork, planning, testing, and maintenance. It's the difference between building a shed in your backyard and building a skyscraper.

## Core Idea
**SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle):** The process used to design, develop, and test high-quality software.
1.  Planning
2.  Analysis
3.  Design
4.  Implementation
5.  Testing
6.  Maintenance

## Formal Definition (if applicable)
**Agile Methodology:** An iterative approach to project management and software development that helps teams deliver value to their customers faster and with fewer headaches.

## Intuition
- **Waterfall:** Plan everything, then build everything, then test everything. (Like building a bridge).
- **Agile:** Build a skateboard, then a scooter, then a bike, then a car. (Iterative improvement based on feedback).

## Examples
- **Git:** Version control system to track changes and collaborate.
- **Unit Testing:** Testing individual functions to ensure they work.
- **CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment):** Automating the release process.

## Common Misconceptions
- "More programmers = faster delivery." (Brooks' Law: Adding manpower to a late software project makes it later.)
- "Code is the only thing that matters." (Documentation, requirements, and communication are equally important.)

## Related Concepts
- **Design Patterns:** Reusable solutions to common problems (e.g., Singleton, Factory).
- **Refactoring:** Improving the structure of code without changing its behavior.
- **Technical Debt:** The implied cost of additional rework caused by choosing an easy solution now instead of a better approach that would take longer.

## Applications
- **Enterprise Software:** Large-scale systems for businesses.
- **Mobile Apps:** Rapid development cycles.
- **Safety-Critical Systems:** Software for planes and medical devices (requires rigorous verification).

## Criticism / Limitations
Software projects are notoriously difficult to estimate and often go over budget and over time.
