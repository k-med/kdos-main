## Overview
Video games are the most complex software on earth. They combine real-time 3D graphics, physics simulation, artificial intelligence, networking, and audio—all running at 60 frames per second. Game Development is the art of juggling all these systems to create fun.

## Core Idea
The core idea is **The Game Loop**.
1.  **Input:** Read the controller (Player pressed 'Jump').
2.  **Update:** Move the character, check for collisions, run AI.
3.  **Render:** Draw the frame to the screen.
Repeat 60 times a second. If you miss a deadline, the game lags.

## Formal Definition
The art and science of creating video games.
Key roles: **Designers** (Rules), **Artists** (Visuals), **Programmers** (Code).

## Intuition
-   **Movie:** Pre-rendered. The director controls the camera.
-   **Game:** Real-time. The player controls the camera. The computer has to draw the world on the fly, no matter where you look.

## Examples
-   **Physics Engines:** Havok / PhysX. The code that calculates how a box tumbles down stairs or how a ragdoll falls. It uses Newton's laws ($F=ma$).
-   **Ray Tracing:** The holy grail of graphics. Simulating individual rays of light bouncing off mirrors and water. It used to take hours to render one frame; now we do it in real-time (RTX).
-   **Procedural Generation:** Minecraft. The world is not built by hand; it is generated by an algorithm (Perlin Noise). It is infinite.

## Common Misconceptions
-   **It's all fun and games:** It is a brutal industry. "Crunch Time" (working 100-hour weeks) is common before a release.
-   **Graphics are everything:** A game with bad graphics but good gameplay (Minecraft, Among Us) can be a hit. A game with great graphics but bad gameplay is a flop.

## Related Concepts
-   **Game Engines:** Unity and Unreal. Tools that give you the physics and rendering out of the box so you can focus on the game logic.
-   **NPC AI:** Finite State Machines. "If player is close -> Attack. If player is far -> Patrol."

## Applications
-   **Simulation:** Pilots train on flight simulators (games). The military uses games for tactical training.

## Criticism / Limitations
-   **Violence:** The eternal debate. Do violent games make violent kids? (Science says mostly no, but it's complicated).
-   **Loot Boxes:** Gambling mechanics in games for kids.
