  Augmented reality (AR) is an interactive experience of a real-world environment where the objects that reside in the real world are enhanced by computer-generated perceptual information, sometimes across multiple sensory modalities, including visual, auditory, haptic, somatosensory and olfactory.

## Overview
Virtual Reality (VR) takes you to a different world (The Matrix). Augmented Reality (AR) brings the digital world to *this* one. It paints pixels over your eyes. It is the Terminator HUD (Heads-Up Display). It is likely the future of the smartphone—not a screen in your hand, but glasses on your face.

## Core Idea
The core idea is **The Overlay**. Mixing the real and the virtual seamlessly. The computer has to understand the 3D geometry of the room (SLAM - Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) to lock the digital object to the table.

## Formal Definition
An interactive experience where real-world objects are enhanced by computer-generated perceptual information.
**AR vs. VR:**
-   **VR:** Replaces reality (Oculus).
-   **AR:** Adds to reality (Pokemon Go).
-   **MR (Mixed Reality):** Virtual objects interact with real objects (a virtual ball bounces off a real table).

## Intuition
-   **Map:** Looking down at your phone to see where to go.
-   **AR:** Looking at the street, and seeing giant blue arrows floating in the air telling you "Turn Left."

## Examples
-   **Pokemon Go:** The game that introduced AR to the masses. You look through your camera, and a Pikachu is standing on the sidewalk.
-   **IKEA Place:** An app that lets you "place" a virtual sofa in your living room to see if it fits and matches the curtains before you buy it.
-   **Surgery:** Surgeons wearing AR glasses that overlay the MRI scan onto the patient's body, so they can see "through" the skin to the tumor.

## Common Misconceptions
-   **It's just for games:** It is a huge productivity tool. Mechanics use it to see repair manuals floating next to the engine.
-   **Google Glass failed:** It failed as a consumer product (too creepy), but it succeeded in factories (Enterprise Edition).

## Related Concepts
-   **Spatial Computing:** The broader term for computers that understand 3D space.
-   **Haptics:** Adding touch. Wearing gloves that let you "feel" the virtual object.

## Applications
-   **Translation:** Google Lens. You point your camera at a menu in Japanese, and it replaces the text with English in the same font. Magic.

## Criticism / Limitations
-   **Field of View:** Current glasses (HoloLens, Magic Leap) have a small window. It's like looking through a mail slot.
-   **Social Acceptance:** "Glassholes." People don't like being recorded by cameras on your face.
