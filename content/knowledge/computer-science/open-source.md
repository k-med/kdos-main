## Overview
Imagine if Coca-Cola published their secret recipe and said, "If you can make it better, go ahead." That is Open Source. It is a movement that believes software should be free—not just free as in "free beer" (price), but free as in "free speech" (liberty). It runs the internet.

## Core Idea
The core idea is **Community Collaboration**. A thousand eyes are better than ten. If the code is open, anyone can find bugs and fix them. The software evolves faster than any single company could manage.

## Formal Definition
Software with source code that anyone can inspect, modify, and enhance.
**The Four Freedoms (FSF):** Run, Study, Redistribute, Modify.

## Intuition
-   **Proprietary (Closed Source):** Buying a car with the hood welded shut. If it breaks, only the dealer can fix it. (Windows, iOS).
-   **Open Source:** Buying a car with the blueprints included. You can fix it, tune it, or build a rocket engine for it. (Linux, Android).

## Examples
-   **Linux:** The operating system that runs 90% of the internet (servers), all supercomputers, and Android phones. Started by one guy (Linus Torvalds) in his bedroom.
-   **Git:** The tool developers use to collaborate. Also written by Linus Torvalds.
-   **Wikipedia:** Open source knowledge.

## Common Misconceptions
-   **It's not secure:** "If hackers can see the code, they can hack it." False. Security through obscurity fails. Open source is secure because thousands of security experts audit the code constantly (Linus's Law).
-   **You can't make money:** Red Hat makes billions selling *support* for Linux. You sell the service, not the code.

## Related Concepts
-   **Copyleft (GPL):** A license that says "You can use this code, but if you modify it, you must share your changes." It forces sharing.
-   **MIT/Apache License:** Permissive licenses. "Do whatever you want with this code, just don't sue me."

## Applications
-   **Science:** Open source is crucial for science. If you publish a paper but hide the code/data, no one can replicate your results.

## Criticism / Limitations
-   **Burnout:** Most open source projects are maintained by volunteers in their spare time. They often get burned out by demanding users. (The "XKCD Dependency" problem).
