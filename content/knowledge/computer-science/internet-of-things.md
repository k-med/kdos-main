## Overview
We used to connect people to the internet (Email). Then we connected pages (Web). Now we are connecting *things*. Toasters, cars, streetlights, cows. The Internet of Things (IoT) is the concept of giving everything a digital nervous system.

## Core Idea
The core idea is **Ubiquitous Sensing**. Making the physical world readable by computers. If your fridge knows you are out of milk, it can order more. If the bridge knows it has a crack, it can call the engineer.

## Formal Definition
A network of physical objects—"things"—that are embedded with sensors, software, and other technologies for the purpose of connecting and exchanging data with other devices and systems over the internet.

## Intuition
-   **Dumb Object:** A chair. It sits there.
-   **Smart Object:** A chair with a pressure sensor. It knows when you sit down. It tells the lights to turn on. It tracks your posture. It talks to your doctor.

## Examples
-   **Smart Home:** Nest Thermostat. It learns your schedule and turns down the heat when you leave to save energy. Philips Hue bulbs that change color with your music.
-   **Industrial IoT (IIoT):** A jet engine with 5,000 sensors. It sends terabytes of data during a flight. GE knows a part is going to break before the plane even lands.
-   **Agriculture:** Sensors in the soil that tell the farmer exactly which plant needs water. "Precision Farming."

## Common Misconceptions
-   **It's just gadgets:** It's mostly industrial. Smart grids, smart cities, supply chain tracking. The consumer stuff (smart toasters) is just the tip of the iceberg.

## Related Concepts
-   **Big Data:** IoT generates the massive data that AI needs to learn.
-   **5G:** The network built for IoT. It allows millions of devices to connect in a small area without jamming.

## Applications
-   **Healthcare:** Wearables (Apple Watch) that monitor your heart 24/7 and call 911 if you fall.

## Criticism / Limitations
-   **Security:** The "S" in IoT stands for Security (joke). Most devices are cheap and have hard-coded passwords. Hackers use them to create botnets (Mirai Botnet) to attack websites.
-   **Privacy:** Your vacuum cleaner is mapping your house. Your TV is listening to your conversation. Who owns that data?
