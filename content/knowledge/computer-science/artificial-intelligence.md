## Overview
AI is the quest to build machines that can think, learn, and perceive. It has moved from symbolic logic ("If A then B") to statistical learning ("Based on 1 million examples, A usually leads to B").

## Core Idea
**Machine Learning:** Instead of programming the rules explicitly, we give the computer data and let it figure out the rules.
**Neural Networks:** Algorithms inspired by the human brain, capable of learning complex patterns (Deep Learning).

## Formal Definition (if applicable)
**Turing Test:** A test of a machine's ability to exhibit intelligent behavior equivalent to, or indistinguishable from, that of a human.

## Intuition
- **Old AI (Symbolic):** Teaching a computer to play chess by programming every rule and strategy.
- **New AI (Machine Learning):** Showing a computer 10,000 games of chess and letting it figure out how to win.

## Examples
- **ChatGPT:** A Large Language Model (LLM) that predicts the next word in a sentence.
- **AlphaGo:** An AI that beat the world champion at Go.
- **Self-Driving Cars:** Using computer vision to navigate.

## Common Misconceptions
- "AI is conscious." (Current AI is just math—matrix multiplication and probability. It has no feelings or awareness.)
- "AI will kill us all." (The risk is less "Terminator" and more "algorithmic bias" or "job displacement.")

## Related Concepts
- **Supervised Learning:** Learning with labeled data (e.g., "This is a cat").
- **Unsupervised Learning:** Finding patterns in unlabeled data.
- **Reinforcement Learning:** Learning by trial and error (rewards/punishments).

## Applications
- **Healthcare:** Diagnosing diseases from X-rays.
- **Finance:** Fraud detection.
- **Art:** Generative AI creating images and music.

## Criticism / Limitations
"Black Box" problem: We often don't know *why* a neural network made a specific decision. Also, AI models can hallucinate (make things up) and perpetuate societal biases.
