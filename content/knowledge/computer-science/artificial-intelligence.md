## Overview
**Artificial Intelligence (AI)** is the quest to build a brain. It is the science of making machines smart.

## Core Idea
The core idea is **Simulation**. Can we simulate the cognitive functions of a human mind (learning, reasoning, problem-solving) in a machine?

## Formal Definition
The study of "intelligent agents": any device that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of successfully achieving its goals.

## Intuition
-   **The Calculator vs. The Poet:** A calculator is better than you at math, but it's not "intelligent" in the AI sense. AI aims for the messy, fuzzy stuff: recognizing a face, driving a car, writing a poem.
-   **Narrow vs. General AI:**
    -   *Narrow AI (ANI):* Good at one thing (Chess, Spam filtering). We have this now.
    -   *General AI (AGI):* Good at everything (like a human). We don't have this yet.

## Examples
-   **Deep Blue:** Beat Kasparov at Chess (1997). (Brute force search).
-   **AlphaGo:** Beat Lee Sedol at Go (2016). (Deep Learning + Reinforcement Learning).
-   **ChatGPT:** Generates human-like text. (Large Language Model).

## Common Misconceptions
-   **Misconception:** AI is conscious.
    -   **Correction:** Current AI is just math. It doesn't "know" anything; it just predicts the next word or pixel.
-   **Misconception:** It will kill us all (Terminator).
    -   **Correction:** The risk is real (Alignment Problem), but it's more about "unintended consequences" than "evil robots."

## Related Concepts
-   **[Machine Learning](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/computer-science/machine-learning.md):** The current dominant approach to AI.
-   **[Turing Test](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/computer-science/turing-test.md):** Can a machine fool a human?

## Applications
-   **Healthcare:** Diagnosing diseases from X-rays.
-   **Transportation:** Self-driving cars.
-   **Creativity:** AI art and music.

## Criticism and Limitations
-   **Hallucination:** AI models often confidently state falsehoods.
-   **Job Displacement:** Automation of cognitive labor.
