summary: >
  A blockchain is a distributed ledger with growing lists of records (blocks) that are securely linked together via cryptographic hashes. Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block, a timestamp, and transaction data.

## Overview
Imagine a notebook that everyone can read, but no one can erase. If you want to write a new page, everyone has to agree that what you wrote is true. Once it's written, it's written in stone forever. That is a blockchain. It is a "Trust Machine."

## Core Idea
The core idea is **Decentralization**. Instead of trusting a bank or a government to keep the ledger (Centralized), we trust the math and the crowd (Distributed).

## Formal Definition
A distributed, immutable ledger consisting of a chain of blocks, where each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block.

## Intuition
-   **Google Doc:** Centralized. Google owns the file. They can delete it.
-   **Blockchain:** Distributed. Everyone has a copy of the file. If one person tries to cheat (change a number), the other 99 people say "That doesn't match our copy" and reject it.

## Examples
-   **Bitcoin:** The first app. Digital money that doesn't require a bank.
-   **Ethereum:** A "World Computer." It allows you to write code (Smart Contracts) that lives on the blockchain. "If X happens, pay Y." It runs automatically without a lawyer.
-   **NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens):** Digital ownership. Proving that *you* own this specific JPEG, even if everyone else can copy-paste it.

## Common Misconceptions
-   **It's anonymous:** It's *pseudonymous*. Your name isn't there, but your wallet address is. And since the ledger is public, anyone can trace your money if they know your address.
-   **It's just for criminals:** It's used for supply chain tracking (Walmart tracks lettuce), voting, and identity.

## Related Concepts
-   **Mining (Proof of Work):** Computers solving hard math puzzles to secure the network. It uses a lot of electricity.
-   **Proof of Stake:** A greener alternative. You "stake" your coins to vouch for the truth. If you lie, you lose your money.

## Applications
-   **Supply Chain:** Tracking a diamond from the mine to the ring to prove it's not a "blood diamond."
-   **DeFi (Decentralized Finance):** Banking without banks. Lending and borrowing directly from other people.

## Criticism / Limitations
-   **Scalability:** Blockchains are slow. Visa can handle 24,000 transactions per second. Bitcoin can handle 7.
-   **Energy:** Bitcoin mining consumes as much energy as Argentina.
