## Overview
**Trickster Figures** are the agents of chaos and change in mythology. They are rule-breakers, boundary-crossers, and pranksters. They are often neither good nor evil, but essential for the world to function.

## Core Idea
The core idea is **disruption**. Order is stagnant; chaos is creative. The trickster breaks the rules of the gods to bring gifts (like fire) to humans, or just for a laugh.

## Formal Definition
A character who exhibits a great degree of intellect or secret knowledge and uses it to play tricks or disobey normal rules. They are often **liminal** figures (existing between worlds).

## Intuition
The Trickster is the **class clown** who is also a genius. He trips the King, steals the sun, and accidentally creates the world while trying to find a snack.

## Examples
-   **Loki (Norse):** Cuts Sif's hair for fun, but then tricks dwarves into making Mjolnir to fix it. Eventually causes the apocalypse.
-   **Coyote (Native American):** A creator and a fool. He teaches humans how to live but often dies or gets humiliated in the process.
-   **Hermes (Greek):** The messenger god, patron of thieves and travelers. He crosses the boundary between Olympus, Earth, and Hades.
-   **Anansi (African):** The spider who uses his wits to defeat stronger opponents.

## Common Misconceptions
-   **Misconception:** They are villains.
    -   **Correction:** They are often **Culture Heroes**. Prometheus (a trickster) saved humanity. They are dangerous but necessary.
-   **Misconception:** They are just funny.
    -   **Correction:** Their humor often reveals deep truths or exposes the hypocrisy of power.

## Related Concepts
-   **[Liminality](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/anthropology/liminality.md):** The quality of ambiguity or disorientation that occurs in the middle stage of a rite of passage.
-   **[Anti-hero](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/literature/anti-hero.md):** A protagonist lacking conventional heroic qualities.
-   **[Archetype](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/psychology/archetype.md):** Jung saw the Trickster as a manifestation of the Shadow.

## Applications
-   **Literature:** Modern tricksters include Bugs Bunny, Jack Sparrow, and The Joker.
-   **Social Commentary:** Satirists and comedians function as modern tricksters.

## Criticism and Limitations
-   **Unpredictability:** You can't trust a trickster. Their "gifts" often come with a terrible price.
