## Overview
**Norse Mythology** is the mythos of the Vikings and North Germanic peoples. It is a stark, fatalistic world of ice and fire, where even the gods are doomed to die.

## Core Idea
The core idea is **inevitable doom**. Unlike the immortal Greek gods, the Norse gods know their end is coming (**Ragnarök**). Heroism is fighting bravely even when you know you will lose.

## Formal Definition
The myths of the Scandinavian people, recorded primarily in the *Poetic Edda* and *Prose Edda* (written by Snorri Sturluson in the 13th century).

## Intuition
It's **heavy metal mythology**.
-   **Valhalla:** A hall where warriors drink and fight all day, waiting for the end of the world.
-   **Yggdrasil:** The World Tree that holds the nine realms together.
-   **Thor:** The hammer-wielding protector of humanity.

## Examples
-   **Odin:** The Allfather, who sacrificed his eye for wisdom and hung himself from the World Tree to learn the runes.
-   **Loki:** The trickster god, a shapeshifter who causes chaos and eventually leads the giants against the gods.
-   **Ragnarök:** The twilight of the gods. A great battle where Odin, Thor, and Loki all die, and the world is reborn.

## Common Misconceptions
-   **Misconception:** Vikings wore horned helmets.
    -   **Correction:** Pure fiction invented by 19th-century opera costume designers.
-   **Misconception:** It's just about fighting.
    -   **Correction:** It has deep wisdom (the *Hávamál*) about hospitality, friendship, and conduct.

## Related Concepts
-   **[Saga](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/literature/saga.md):** Prose narratives about Viking history and families.
-   **[Runes](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/history/runes.md):** The alphabet used by Germanic peoples, often associated with magic.
-   **[Beowulf](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/literature/beowulf.md):** An Old English epic deeply rooted in Germanic/Norse tradition.

## Applications
-   **Fantasy Literature:** Tolkien heavily borrowed from Norse myth (Gandalf is based on Odin; dwarves and elves are Norse concepts).
-   **Pop Culture:** Marvel's Thor movies.

## Criticism and Limitations
-   **Fragmentary Sources:** Most of what we know comes from Christian writers (like Snorri) writing centuries after the religion had faded, so it may be distorted.
