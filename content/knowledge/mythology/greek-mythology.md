## Overview
**Greek Mythology** is the collection of stories about the gods, heroes, and rituals of the ancient Greeks. It is the foundation of Western literature and art, influencing everything from Shakespeare to modern superhero movies.

## Core Idea
The core idea is **anthropomorphism**. The Greek gods were not distant, abstract forces; they were super-powered humans. They felt jealousy, rage, lust, and love. They were flawed, petty, and magnificent.

## Formal Definition
The body of myths originally told by the ancient Greeks, concerning their gods and heroes, the nature of the world, and the origins and significance of their own cult and ritual practices.

## Intuition
It's a **soap opera on a cosmic scale**.
-   **Zeus:** The King, powerful but unfaithful.
-   **Hera:** The Queen, jealous and vengeful.
-   **The Iliad:** A war started over a beauty contest and a stolen wife.

## Examples
-   **The Twelve Olympians:** The major deities living on Mount Olympus (Zeus, Hera, Poseidon, Athena, etc.).
-   **Heracles (Hercules):** The greatest hero, known for his strength and his Twelve Labors.
-   **Prometheus:** The Titan who stole fire from the gods to give to humanity and was punished eternally.

## Common Misconceptions
-   **Misconception:** It was a "Bible" for Greeks.
    -   **Correction:** There was no single sacred text. Myths varied by city and poet. It was a fluid oral tradition.
-   **Misconception:** Hades is the Devil.
    -   **Correction:** Hades is the ruler of the Underworld (the dead), but he is not evil. He is just a bureaucrat.

## Related Concepts
-   **[Roman Mythology](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/mythology/roman-mythology.md):** Largely adapted from Greek myths (Zeus -> Jupiter).
-   **[Tragedy](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/literature/tragedy.md):** Greek plays exploring the downfall of heroes (Oedipus).
-   **[Philosophy](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/philosophy/philosophy.md):** Greek philosophy began as a critique of mythology (Logos vs. Mythos).

## Applications
-   **Psychology:** Freud used Greek myths to name complexes (Oedipus Complex, Narcissism).
-   **Astronomy:** Most constellations and planets are named after Greek/Roman figures.

## Criticism and Limitations
-   **Misogyny:** Women in Greek myths are often treated as property or sources of trouble (Pandora, Helen).
