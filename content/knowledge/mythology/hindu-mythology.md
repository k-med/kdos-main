## Overview
**Hindu Mythology** is a vast, living tradition. Unlike Greek or Norse myths, these stories are still sacred to over a billion people. It is a complex tapestry of philosophy, cosmology, and epic storytelling.

## Core Idea
The core idea is **Dharma** (Cosmic Order) and **Moksha** (Liberation). The universe is an endless cycle of creation, preservation, and destruction. The goal is to escape this cycle.

## Formal Definition
The narratives found in Hindu texts like the *Vedas*, *Puranas*, and the epics *Ramayana* and *Mahabharata*. It features the **Trimurti**:
-   **Brahma:** The Creator.
-   **Vishnu:** The Preserver.
-   **Shiva:** The Destroyer.

## Intuition
It's **fractal mythology**. There are millions of gods, but they are all manifestations of the one ultimate reality (**Brahman**). Time is cyclic, spanning billions of years (Yugas).

## Examples
-   **The Ramayana:** Prince Rama (avatar of Vishnu) rescues his wife Sita from the demon king Ravana with the help of the monkey god Hanuman.
-   **The Mahabharata:** A massive war between cousins (Pandavas vs. Kauravas). Contains the *Bhagavad Gita*, where Krishna teaches Arjuna about duty.
-   **Churning of the Ocean:** Gods and demons work together to churn the cosmic ocean to obtain the nectar of immortality.

## Common Misconceptions
-   **Misconception:** It is polytheistic.
    -   **Correction:** It is often described as **Henotheism** (worshipping one god without denying others) or **Monism** (all is one).
-   **Misconception:** Karma is fate.
    -   **Correction:** Karma is action and consequence. You create your own future through your actions.

## Related Concepts
-   **[Avatar](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/theology/avatar.md):** The descent of a deity to earth (e.g., Vishnu has 10 avatars).
-   **[Yoga](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/philosophy/yoga.md):** Spiritual practices derived from Hindu philosophy.
-   **[Sanskrit](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/linguistics/sanskrit.md):** The classical language of Hindu texts.

## Applications
-   **Ethics:** The concept of Dharma (duty/righteousness) guides daily life.
-   **Art:** Indian dance, music, and sculpture are deeply rooted in mythology.

## Criticism and Limitations
-   **Caste System:** Mythology has been used to justify social hierarchy (Purusha Sukta), though many modern interpretations reject this.
