## Overview
**Comparative Mythology** is the study of myths from different cultures to find common patterns. It asks: Why do so many disconnected cultures have stories about a Great Flood, a Dying God, or a Trickster?

## Core Idea
The core idea is **universality**. Despite vast distances, human beings share the same fundamental fears, hopes, and psychological structures, leading to similar stories.

## Formal Definition
The academic field that compares myths to uncover shared themes (archetypes), trace historical connections (diffusion), or understand the human mind (psychology).

## Intuition
It's **pattern matching for culture**.
-   Greek Zeus vs. Norse Odin vs. Hindu Indra (Sky Fathers).
-   Greek Achilles vs. Norse Siegfried (Invulnerable heroes with one weak spot).
-   Biblical Noah vs. Sumerian Utnapishtim (Flood survivors).

## Examples
-   **The Flood Myth:** Found in the Bible, Gilgamesh, Hindu texts, and Mayan legends. Suggests a shared historical memory or psychological symbol of cleansing.
-   **The Dying and Rising God:** Osiris, Jesus, Dionysus, Baldr. Represents the cycle of seasons and agriculture.
-   **The Axis Mundi:** The center of the world (Yggdrasil, Mount Olympus, Mount Meru).

## Common Misconceptions
-   **Misconception:** All myths are the same.
    -   **Correction:** While they share *structures*, the *meaning* and details are unique to each culture. Reducing them all to one "Monomyth" ignores cultural diversity.
-   **Misconception:** Similar myths prove contact (e.g., Aliens built the pyramids).
    -   **Correction:** Independent invention is common. People everywhere see the sun and die; they will invent stories about the sun and death.

## Related Concepts
-   **[Archetype](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/psychology/archetype.md):** A universally understood symbol or pattern of behavior (Jung).
-   **[Structuralism](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/anthropology/structuralism.md):** Analyzing myths as systems of binary oppositions (Lévi-Strauss).
-   **[The Hero's Journey](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/mythology/the-heros-journey.md):** The most famous pattern identified by Joseph Campbell.

## Applications
-   **Storytelling:** Screenwriters (like George Lucas) use comparative mythology to create resonant stories (Star Wars).
-   **Psychology:** Understanding the collective unconscious.

## Criticism and Limitations
-   **Over-generalization:** Joseph Campbell is often criticized by folklorists for forcing myths to fit his pattern and ignoring context.
