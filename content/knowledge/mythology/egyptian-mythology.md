## Overview
**Egyptian Mythology** is one of the oldest and most enduring belief systems. It centered on the Pharaoh as a living god, the cyclical nature of the Nile, and an obsessive preparation for the Afterlife.

## Core Idea
The core idea is **Ma'at** (Order/Balance). The universe is a constant battle between Ma'at and Isfet (Chaos). The Pharaoh's job was to maintain Ma'at so the sun would rise and the Nile would flood.

## Formal Definition
The myths and religious beliefs of ancient Egypt, spanning over 3,000 years. It involves a vast pantheon of animal-headed gods.

## Intuition
It's a **cult of death and rebirth**.
-   **The Sun (Ra):** Dies every night and is reborn every morning.
-   **The Nile:** Dries up and floods every year.
-   **The Soul:** Survives death if the body is preserved (mummification) and the heart is light.

## Examples
-   **Osiris Myth:** Osiris is murdered by his brother Set, reassembled by his wife Isis, and becomes the King of the Dead. His son Horus defeats Set to become King of the Living (the Pharaoh).
-   **Weighing of the Heart:** In the afterlife, your heart is weighed against a feather (Ma'at). If it's heavier (full of sin), you are eaten by a monster.

## Common Misconceptions
-   **Misconception:** They worshipped cats.
    -   **Correction:** They worshipped the *divine power* in cats (Bastet). Animals were seen as vessels for the gods.
-   **Misconception:** Slaves built the pyramids.
    -   **Correction:** Archaeological evidence suggests they were built by paid laborers and skilled craftsmen.

## Related Concepts
-   **[Hieroglyphs](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/linguistics/hieroglyphs.md):** The sacred writing system of Egypt.
-   **[Mummification](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/history/mummification.md):** The process of preserving the body for the afterlife.
-   **[Polytheism](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/theology/polytheism.md):** Belief in many gods.

## Applications
-   **Architecture:** The pyramids and temples are direct expressions of their mythology.
-   **Occultism:** Western esotericism (Hermeticism) is heavily influenced by Egyptian ideas.

## Criticism and Limitations
-   **Consistency:** Egyptian myth is full of contradictions (creation stories vary by city), which didn't bother the Egyptians but confuses modern readers.
