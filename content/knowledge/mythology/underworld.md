## Overview
The **Underworld** is the realm of the dead. It is a universal feature of mythology, representing the unknown, the subconscious, and the ultimate destination of all living things.

## Core Idea
The core idea is **separation**. The dead are not gone; they are *elsewhere*. This place is usually physically "down" (buried), dark, and difficult to return from.

## Formal Definition
The supernatural world of the dead, located below the surface of the earth. Also known as the netherworld or chthonic realm.

## Intuition
It's the **basement of the universe**. It's where you put things you want to hide or things that are finished. But sometimes, heroes must go down there to find lost things (souls, knowledge).

## Examples
-   **Hades (Greek):** A gray, misty place where shades wander aimlessly. Not necessarily a place of punishment (that's Tartarus).
-   **Duat (Egyptian):** A perilous landscape full of monsters that the soul must navigate to reach paradise.
-   **Hel (Norse):** A cold, damp realm for those who didn't die in battle.
-   **Xibalba (Mayan):** The "Place of Fear," ruled by death gods who challenge visitors to deadly ball games.

## Common Misconceptions
-   **Misconception:** Underworld = Hell.
    -   **Correction:** The Christian Hell is a place of punishment. Most mythological underworlds are just holding pens for *all* dead souls, good or bad.
-   **Misconception:** Satan rules the Underworld.
    -   **Correction:** In most myths, the ruler (Hades, Osiris, Hel) is a legitimate god, not a rebel or demon.

## Related Concepts
-   **[Katabasis](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/mythology/katabasis.md):** The hero's descent into the underworld (e.g., Orpheus, Dante).
-   **[Chthonic](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/mythology/chthonic.md):** Relating to or inhabiting the underworld (as opposed to Ouranic/Olympian sky gods).
-   **[Necromancy](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/mythology/necromancy.md):** Communicating with the dead.

## Applications
-   **Psychology:** Jung viewed the descent into the underworld as confronting the unconscious.
-   **Literature:** Dante's *Inferno* is the ultimate tour of the underworld.

## Criticism and Limitations
-   **Fear:** The concept of the underworld reinforces the fear of death and the dark.
