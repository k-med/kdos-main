## Overview
**Monsters** are the embodiment of our fears. They are the "Other"—that which is not human, not natural, and dangerous. They exist to be fought, fled from, or understood.

## Core Idea
The core idea is **transgression**. Monsters cross boundaries. They mix categories (man + wolf, dead + alive, lizard + bird). They represent chaos threatening the order of civilization.

## Formal Definition
From the Latin *monstrum* (divine omen/warning). A creature that violates the laws of nature and threatens the social order.

## Intuition
Monsters are **warnings**.
-   **Dragons:** Warning against greed (hoarding gold).
-   **Vampires:** Warning against parasitic aristocracy or sexual deviance.
-   **Zombies:** Warning against mindless conformity or pandemics.

## Examples
-   **The Sphinx:** A hybrid (lion/human) that asks riddles. If you don't know the answer (knowledge), it kills you.
-   **Medusa:** A woman whose gaze turns men to stone. Represents the paralyzing power of fear (or female rage).
-   **Leviathan:** The sea monster representing primordial chaos.

## Common Misconceptions
-   **Misconception:** Monsters are just for scaring kids.
    -   **Correction:** They are complex cultural symbols. "We create monsters to stand in for what we cannot face."
-   **Misconception:** They are always evil.
    -   **Correction:** In modern stories (Frankenstein, King Kong), the monster is often a sympathetic victim of human cruelty.
