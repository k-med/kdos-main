## Overview
**The Hero's Journey** (or Monomyth) is a narrative pattern identified by Joseph Campbell that appears in drama, storytelling, myth, religious ritual, and psychological development. It describes the typical adventure of the archetype known as The Hero.

## Core Idea
The core idea is **transformation through ordeal**. The hero leaves the known world, faces the unknown, dies (symbolically), is reborn, and returns with a gift for their community.

## Formal Definition
Campbell summarizes it: "A hero ventures forth from the world of common day into a region of supernatural wonder: fabulous forces are there encountered and a decisive victory is won: the hero comes back from this mysterious adventure with the power to bestow boons on his fellow man."

## Intuition
It's the structure of **growing up**.
1.  **Departure:** Leaving mom's basement (Call to Adventure).
2.  **Initiation:** Facing the real world, getting a job, failing, learning (Trials).
3.  **Return:** Coming back as a mature adult (Master of Two Worlds).

## Examples
-   **Star Wars:** Luke leaves Tatooine, learns the Force, destroys the Death Star, and becomes a Jedi.
-   **The Matrix:** Neo takes the Red Pill, trains, defeats Smith, and becomes the One.
-   **The Odyssey:** Odysseus leaves Troy, faces monsters for 10 years, and returns to reclaim his throne.

## Common Misconceptions
-   **Misconception:** Every story must follow it exactly.
    -   **Correction:** It's a flexible framework, not a rigid checklist. Not all steps appear in every myth.
-   **Misconception:** It's just for action movies.
    -   **Correction:** It applies to psychological dramas and spiritual journeys (e.g., Jane Eyre, Buddha).

## Applications
-   **Screenwriting:** The standard blueprint for Hollywood blockbusters (Christopher Vogler's *The Writer's Journey*).
-   **Therapy:** Framing personal trauma as a hero's journey to find meaning.

## Criticism and Limitations
-   **Gender Bias:** The classic model is very male-centric (conquering, killing). Some argue for a "Heroine's Journey" focused more on connection and integration.
