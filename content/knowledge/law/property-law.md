## Overview
"This is mine." What does that mean? It means I can exclude you from it. Property is a "bundle of rights" (Right to use, right to sell, right to destroy).

## Core Idea
**Real Property vs. Personal Property:**
- **Real Property:** Land and buildings (Immovable).
- **Personal Property:** Cars, computers, furniture (Movable).

## Formal Definition (if applicable)
**Adverse Possession:** "Squatter's Rights." If you occupy someone's land openly and continuously for a long time (e.g., 20 years), it becomes yours. (Encourages land use).

## Intuition
- **Title:** The piece of paper that says you own it.
- **Easement:** The right to cross someone else's land (e.g., a utility company running power lines).

## Examples
- **Intellectual Property (IP):** Owning ideas.
    - **Copyright:** Art/Books.
    - **Patent:** Inventions.
    - **Trademark:** Brands.
- **Eminent Domain:** The government can take your land for public use (e.g., building a highway), but they must pay you "Just Compensation."

## Common Misconceptions
- "I own the air above my house." (Only up to a certain height. Planes can fly over).
- "Finders Keepers." (Actually, you have a duty to try to find the owner).

## Related Concepts
- **Zoning:** Laws saying what you can build where (Residential vs. Commercial).
- **Trusts and Estates:** Passing property after death.
- **Tragedy of the Commons:** Property that no one owns gets destroyed (e.g., overfishing).

## Applications
- **Housing:** Buying a home is the biggest property transaction for most people.
- **Business:** Protecting assets.

## Criticism / Limitations
"Property is Theft" (Proudhon). Does private property create inequality?
