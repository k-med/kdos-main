## Overview
If I steal your apple, you have no apple. If I steal your idea, you still have the idea, but now I have it too. IP law tries to balance the spread of ideas with the need to reward inventors.

## Core Idea
**The Big Three:**
1.  **Copyright:** Protects *expression* (Books, Music, Code). Lasts Life + 70 years.
2.  **Patent:** Protects *inventions* (Machines, Drugs). Lasts 20 years. Must be novel and non-obvious.
3.  **Trademark:** Protects *brands* (Logos, Slogans). Lasts forever as long as used. Prevents consumer confusion.

## Formal Definition (if applicable)
**Fair Use:** You can use copyrighted material without permission for criticism, news, teaching, or parody. (This is why you can quote a book in a review).

## Intuition
- **Trade Secret:** A secret recipe (Coca-Cola). No registration needed, but if someone figures it out, you have no protection.
- **Public Domain:** Works whose IP has expired. Shakespeare is free for everyone.

## Examples
- **Apple vs. Samsung:** Patent war over the shape of the iPhone.
- **Disney:** Mickey Mouse entering the public domain (Steamboat Willie).
- **Open Source:** Using copyright to enforce sharing (Copyleft).

## Common Misconceptions
- "I mailed it to myself so it's copyrighted." (Poor Man's Copyright—doesn't really help in court. Copyright exists the moment you create the work).
- "If I change 10%, it's okay." (No, it's still infringement if it's "substantially similar.")

## Related Concepts
- **Patent Troll:** A company that buys patents just to sue people, not to make products.
- **Digital Rights Management (DRM):** Software locks to prevent copying.

## Applications
- **Tech Industry:** Software patents.
- **Pharma:** Drug patents (Generic vs. Brand name).
- **Music:** Sampling.

## Criticism / Limitations
"Information wants to be free." Does IP stifle innovation by creating monopolies?
