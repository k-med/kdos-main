## Overview
If I punch you, that's a crime (Assault). But it's also a Tort (Battery). Criminal law punishes me; Tort law pays you. It's about shifting the cost of accidents to the person who caused them.

## Core Idea
**Negligence:** The most common tort. You didn't mean to hurt anyone, but you were careless.
1.  **Duty:** You had a duty to be careful (e.g., drive safely).
2.  **Breach:** You failed (texted while driving).
3.  **Causation:** Your failure caused the accident.
4.  **Damages:** The victim was hurt.

## Formal Definition (if applicable)
**Strict Liability:** You are responsible even if you were careful. (e.g., Keeping a tiger as a pet. If it bites someone, you pay, even if you had a great fence).

## Intuition
- **The Reasonable Person:** The imaginary person the law compares you to. "Would a reasonable person have mopped up that spill?"
- **Deep Pockets:** Lawyers sue the person with money (Insurance companies, Corporations).

## Examples
- **Medical Malpractice:** A doctor makes a mistake.
- **Product Liability:** A toaster explodes.
- **Defamation:** Libel (written) or Slander (spoken) lies that hurt someone's reputation.

## Common Misconceptions
- "The McDonald's Coffee Case." (She spilled coffee and got millions? Actually, the coffee was superheated to 190°F, caused 3rd-degree burns, and McDonald's had been warned 700 times. The jury punished them for not fixing it.)

## Related Concepts
- **Punitive Damages:** Extra money to punish the bad guy (not just compensate the victim).
- **Class Action:** A lot of people suing together.

## Applications
- **Insurance:** Exists to pay for torts.
- **Safety Regulations:** Often written to avoid lawsuits.

## Criticism / Limitations
"Ambulance Chasers." Does the system encourage frivolous lawsuits?
