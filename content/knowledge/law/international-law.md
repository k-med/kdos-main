## Overview
Who polices the police? In a world of sovereign nations, there is no "World Government." International law is a system of agreements and norms to keep the peace.

## Core Idea
**Sovereignty:** The idea that a state has absolute power within its own borders. No other country can tell it what to do. International law is a voluntary limitation of sovereignty.

## Formal Definition (if applicable)
**Treaty:** A contract between countries. (e.g., NATO, Paris Climate Agreement). Once signed and ratified, it becomes law.

## Intuition
It's like a neighborhood association. There are rules (don't burn leaves), but if you break them, the neighbors can't arrest you—they can only shun you (Sanctions) or fight you (War).

## Examples
- **Geneva Conventions:** Rules of war (Don't shoot prisoners, don't bomb hospitals).
- **Law of the Sea:** Who owns the ocean? (12 miles out is yours; 200 miles is your economic zone).
- **International Criminal Court (ICC):** Prosecutes individuals for genocide and war crimes.

## Common Misconceptions
- "It's not real law." (It is, but enforcement is weak. It relies on reciprocity—"I won't kill your diplomats if you don't kill mine.")
- "The UN is a world government." (It's a forum for discussion, not a government).

## Related Concepts
- **Customary International Law:** Rules that everyone follows even without a treaty (e.g., Diplomatic Immunity).
- **Human Rights:** Rights you have just by being human, regardless of what your government says.

## Applications
- **Trade:** WTO (World Trade Organization) rules.
- **Environment:** Climate change treaties.

## Criticism / Limitations
"The strong do what they can and the weak suffer what they must." (Thucydides). Powerful nations often ignore international law when it suits them.
