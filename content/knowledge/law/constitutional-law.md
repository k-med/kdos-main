## Overview
The "Supreme Law of the Land." It sets the rules for the game of government. If a law conflicts with the Constitution, the law dies.

## Core Idea
**Separation of Powers:** To prevent tyranny, power is split into three branches:
1.  **Legislative:** Makes laws (Congress).
2.  **Executive:** Enforces laws (President).
3.  **Judicial:** Interprets laws (Courts).

## Formal Definition (if applicable)
**Judicial Review:** The power of courts to declare laws unconstitutional. (Established in *Marbury v. Madison*).

## Intuition
The Constitution is a contract between the people and the government. It says: "You can do X, Y, and Z, but you absolutely cannot do A, B, or C."

## Examples
- **First Amendment:** Freedom of speech, religion, and press.
- **Due Process:** The government can't take your life, liberty, or property without a fair procedure (trial).
- **Federalism:** Power is shared between the national government and the states.

## Common Misconceptions
- "The Constitution gives us rights." (The Bill of Rights *protects* pre-existing rights from the government. It assumes we already have them.)
- "It never changes." (It has been amended 27 times).

## Related Concepts
- **Originalism:** Interpreting the text as it was understood when written.
- **Living Constitution:** Interpreting the text in the context of modern times.
- **Checks and Balances:** Each branch can limit the others (Veto, Impeachment).

## Applications
- **Civil Rights:** *Brown v. Board of Education* (ended segregation).
- **Privacy:** *Roe v. Wade* (abortion rights, later overturned).

## Criticism / Limitations
It's old. Written by men who owned slaves and rode horses. Does it apply to the internet?
