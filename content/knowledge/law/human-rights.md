## Overview
Rights you have simply because you are human. Not because the King gave them to you, but because you exist.

## Core Idea
**Universal Declaration of Human Rights (UDHR):** Adopted by the UN in 1948 (after the horrors of WWII). Eleanor Roosevelt called it the "Magna Carta for all mankind."

## Formal Definition (if applicable)
**Negative Rights:** Freedom *from* interference (Free Speech, No Torture). The government just has to leave you alone.
**Positive Rights:** Freedom *to* something (Education, Healthcare). The government has to provide something.

## Intuition
- **Inalienable:** You can't lose them, and you can't sell them.
- **Universal:** They apply everywhere, regardless of culture.

## Examples
- **Article 1:** "All human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights."
- **Amnesty International:** An NGO that fights for political prisoners.
- **Refugee Rights:** The right to seek asylum.

## Common Misconceptions
- "Rights are absolute." (No, your right to swing your fist ends where my nose begins. Rights can be limited for public safety).
- "Economic rights aren't real rights." (Controversial. The US focuses on political rights; other countries emphasize economic rights).

## Related Concepts
- **Cultural Relativism:** The argument that "Western" human rights shouldn't apply to other cultures. (Often used by dictators to justify abuse).
- **Humanitarian Intervention:** Using force to stop genocide (R2P: Responsibility to Protect).

## Applications
- **International Law:** War crimes tribunals.
- **Corporate Responsibility:** Nike and sweatshops.

## Criticism / Limitations
Enforcement. Who stops a dictator from killing his own people? (Usually no one, unless they have oil).
