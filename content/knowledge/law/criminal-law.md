## Overview
The state vs. You. In civil law (Torts/Contracts), two people argue over money. In criminal law, the government tries to take away your liberty because you broke the social contract.

## Core Idea
**Actus Reus + Mens Rea = Crime.**
- **Actus Reus:** The Guilty Act (You stole the car).
- **Mens Rea:** The Guilty Mind (You *intended* to steal it).
If you took the car by mistake thinking it was yours, there is no Mens Rea, so no crime.

## Formal Definition (if applicable)
**Presumption of Innocence:** "Innocent until proven guilty." The burden of proof is on the state. They must prove it "Beyond a Reasonable Doubt" (99% sure).

## Intuition
- **Felony:** Serious crime (Murder, Robbery). >1 year in prison.
- **Misdemeanor:** Minor crime (Shoplifting, Jaywalking). <1 year in jail or fine.

## Examples
- **Homicide:** Killing a person.
    - **Murder:** Intentional.
    - **Manslaughter:** Accidental or heat of passion.
- **Self-Defense:** You can use force to protect yourself, but it must be proportional.

## Common Misconceptions
- "I didn't know it was illegal." (Ignorance of the law is no excuse.)
- "Entrapment." (It's only entrapment if the police *forced* you to do something you wouldn't have done otherwise. Buying drugs from an undercover cop is not entrapment.)

## Related Concepts
- **Miranda Rights:** "You have the right to remain silent."
- **Double Jeopardy:** You can't be tried twice for the same crime.
- **Plea Bargain:** Admitting guilt in exchange for a lighter sentence (90% of cases end this way).

## Applications
- **Policing:** Arrest and investigation.
- **Corrections:** Prison and parole.

## Criticism / Limitations
Mass Incarceration. The US has 4% of the world's population but 25% of its prisoners.
