## Overview
"A deal is a deal." Contract law is the glue of capitalism. It allows strangers to trust each other because the state will enforce their promises.

## Core Idea
**Elements of a Contract:**
1.  **Offer:** "I will sell you my car for \$5,000."
2.  **Acceptance:** "I agree."
3.  **Consideration:** Something of value exchanged (Money for Car). A promise without consideration is a gift, not a contract.

## Formal Definition (if applicable)
**Breach of Contract:** Failing to perform your side of the deal. The remedy is usually money (Damages), not forcing you to do the work (Specific Performance).

## Intuition
- **Written vs. Oral:** Oral contracts are valid, but hard to prove. "Get it in writing."
- **Capacity:** You can't make a contract if you are a minor, drunk, or insane.

## Examples
- **Employment Contract:** You work, they pay.
- **Terms of Service:** That long document you didn't read but clicked "I Agree" to. (It's a valid contract).
- **NDA (Non-Disclosure Agreement):** Promising to keep a secret.

## Common Misconceptions
- "I can cancel within 3 days." (Only for specific things like door-to-door sales. Generally, once you sign, you are stuck.)
- "I didn't read it." (Doesn't matter. You are still bound by it.)

## Related Concepts
- **Force Majeure:** "Act of God." An event (like a hurricane) that excuses you from the contract.
- **Statute of Frauds:** Certain contracts (Real Estate, Marriage) *must* be in writing to be valid.

## Applications
- **Business:** Every transaction is a contract.
- **Real Estate:** Leases and mortgages.

## Criticism / Limitations
"Adhesion Contracts." Big companies give you a "Take it or leave it" contract. You have no bargaining power.
