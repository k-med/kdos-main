## Overview
The philosophy of law. What *is* law? Is it just whatever the King says? Or does it have to be moral to be a real law?

## Core Idea
**Natural Law vs. Legal Positivism:**
- **Natural Law:** Law comes from nature/God/Reason. An unjust law is no law at all. (MLK: "One has a moral responsibility to disobey unjust laws.")
- **Legal Positivism:** Law is just a set of rules made by humans. It doesn't have to be moral. If the Nazis pass a law, it's the law. (Hart).

## Formal Definition (if applicable)
**Legal Realism:** Law is what judges *do*, not what the book says. Judges are human; they have biases and eat breakfast. "The life of the law has not been logic: it has been experience." (Holmes).

## Intuition
- **The Grudge Informer Case:** After WWII, Germans who informed on their neighbors under Nazi laws were prosecuted. They argued, "I was following the law." Courts had to decide: Was Nazi law valid law?

## Examples
- **Critical Legal Studies (CLS):** Law is a tool of power used by the rich to oppress the poor.
- **Law and Economics:** Analyzing laws based on efficiency. (Is it cheaper to prevent accidents or pay for them?).

## Common Misconceptions
- "Law is black and white." (It's mostly gray. That's why we have judges).

## Related Concepts
- **Rule of Law:** No one is above the law.
- **Stare Decisis:** Precedent. Courts should follow previous decisions to be consistent.

## Applications
- **Judicial Philosophy:** How should a judge interpret the Constitution?
- **Civil Disobedience:** Breaking the law to change the law.

## Criticism / Limitations
It can get very abstract. Does it help a lawyer win a case? (Maybe not directly, but it helps understand the system).
