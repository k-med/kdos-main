## Overview
Thermodynamics tells you *how much* heat moves. Heat transfer tells you *how fast* it moves. This is critical for keeping computers cool and houses warm.

## Core Idea
**Modes of Heat Transfer:**
1.  **Conduction:** Direct contact (touching a hot stove).
2.  **Convection:** Fluid motion (hot air rising, wind chill).
3.  **Radiation:** Electromagnetic waves (sunlight, feeling heat from a fire).

## Formal Definition (if applicable)
**Fourier's Law of Conduction:** Heat flux is proportional to the temperature gradient. Heat flows from hot to cold.

## Intuition
- **Insulation:** Slowing down heat transfer (a winter coat traps air, which is a bad conductor).
- **Heat Sink:** Increasing surface area to speed up heat transfer (fins on a computer chip).

## Examples
- **Double-Pane Windows:** Trapping air between glass to insulate.
- **Car Radiator:** Using air flow to cool the coolant.
- **Thermos:** Using a vacuum (no matter) to stop conduction and convection.

## Common Misconceptions
- "Cold flows in." (There is no such thing as "cold energy." Cold is just the absence of heat. Heat flows out.)
- "Fans cool the room." (Fans cool *you* by evaporation/convection, but the motor actually adds heat to the room.)

## Related Concepts
- **Thermal Conductivity ($k$):** How well a material conducts heat (Copper = High, Styrofoam = Low).
- **Black Body Radiation:** An idealized object that absorbs all radiation.
- **Heat Exchanger:** A device to transfer heat between two fluids without mixing them.

## Applications
- **Electronics Cooling:** Preventing CPUs from melting.
- **Building Design:** Energy efficiency.
- **Cooking:** Baking (convection) vs. Broiling (radiation).

## Criticism / Limitations
Predicting convection is difficult because it depends on fluid flow (turbulence).
