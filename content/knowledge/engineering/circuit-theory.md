  Circuit theory is the study of how electrical networks behave. It deals with the analysis of circuits containing passive elements (resistors, capacitors, inductors) and active elements (sources).

## Overview
Electricity powers the world. Circuit theory is the language of electronics. It explains how to route electrons to do useful work, from lighting a bulb to processing information.

## Core Idea
**Ohm's Law:** $V = IR$. Voltage (Pressure) = Current (Flow) $\times$ Resistance (Restriction). This simple equation is the foundation of everything.

## Formal Definition (if applicable)
**Kirchhoff's Laws:**
1.  **KCL (Current Law):** What goes in must come out (Conservation of Charge).
2.  **KVL (Voltage Law):** The sum of voltage drops in a loop is zero (Conservation of Energy).

## Intuition
Water Analogy:
- **Voltage:** Water pressure (pump).
- **Current:** Water flow rate (gallons per minute).
- **Resistance:** Narrow pipe.
- **Capacitor:** Water tank (storage).
- **Inductor:** Heavy water wheel (inertia).

## Examples
- **Series Circuit:** Old Christmas lights (one goes out, they all go out).
- **Parallel Circuit:** House wiring (one light goes out, the rest stay on).
- **AC vs. DC:** AC (Alternating Current) for power grid; DC (Direct Current) for batteries/electronics.

## Common Misconceptions
- "Electrons move fast." (They actually move very slowly—drift velocity. The *energy* wave moves at the speed of light.)
- "Batteries store charge." (They store chemical energy.)

## Related Concepts
- **Power:** $P = VI$ (Watts).
- **Impedance:** Resistance in AC circuits (includes frequency effects).
- **Semiconductors:** Diodes and Transistors (electronic switches).

## Applications
- **Electronics:** Phones, computers, TVs.
- **Power Systems:** Grid distribution.
- **Automotive:** Electric vehicles.

## Criticism / Limitations
Ideal circuit models ignore real-world effects like parasitic resistance and electromagnetic interference (EMI).
