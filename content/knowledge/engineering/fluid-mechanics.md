## Overview
Air and water are fluids. Understanding how they move is essential for designing airplanes, ships, pipelines, and even artificial hearts.

## Core Idea
**Bernoulli's Principle:** As the speed of a fluid increases, its pressure decreases. This is why airplanes fly (air moves faster over the curved top of the wing, creating lower pressure and lift).

## Formal Definition (if applicable)
**Viscosity:** A measure of a fluid's resistance to deformation (thickness). Honey has high viscosity; water has low viscosity.

## Intuition
- **Laminar Flow:** Smooth, orderly flow (like water from a tap turned on slightly).
- **Turbulent Flow:** Chaotic, mixing flow (like whitewater rapids).

## Examples
- **Aerodynamics:** Reducing drag on cars to save fuel.
- **Hydraulics:** Using fluid pressure to lift heavy loads (brakes, cranes).
- **Weather:** The atmosphere is a giant fluid system.

## Common Misconceptions
- "Fluids are just liquids." (Gases are fluids too because they flow.)
- "Thicker fluids are heavier." (Viscosity is not density. Oil is viscous but floats on water.)

## Related Concepts
- **Reynolds Number:** A dimensionless number used to predict if flow will be laminar or turbulent.
- **Buoyancy:** The upward force exerted by a fluid (Archimedes' Principle).
- **Surface Tension:** The elastic tendency of a fluid surface.

## Applications
- **Civil Engineering:** Designing dams and water supply systems.
- **Biomedical Engineering:** Blood flow in arteries.
- **Sports:** The curveball in baseball (Magnus Effect).

## Criticism / Limitations
The Navier-Stokes equations (which describe fluid motion) are so complex that we still can't solve them perfectly for turbulence. It's one of the Millennium Prize Problems.
