## Overview
Scientists discover what is. Engineers create what has never been. Design is the creative heart of engineering. It's about solving problems under constraints.

## Core Idea
**Iterative Process:** Design is a cycle, not a straight line.
1.  Define Problem.
2.  Brainstorm.
3.  Prototype.
4.  Test.
5.  Refine.
6.  Repeat.

## Formal Definition (if applicable)
**Constraints:** The limits you must work within (Budget, Time, Physics, Regulations).
**Criteria:** The goals you want to achieve (Speed, Safety, Aesthetics).

## Intuition
Building a bridge.
- **Constraint:** Must cost < $10M. Must span 500ft.
- **Criteria:** Must look good. Must last 100 years.
- **Trade-off:** Stronger materials cost more.

## Examples
- **CAD (Computer-Aided Design):** Using software to model parts in 3D before building them.
- **Rapid Prototyping:** 3D printing a model to test fit and form.
- **Failure Analysis:** Studying why things broke to design them better next time.

## Common Misconceptions
- "Design is just making it look good." (That's styling. Engineering design is about function.)
- "The first idea is the best." (It rarely is. You need to fail fast and iterate.)

## Related Concepts
- **Systems Engineering:** Managing complex projects with many parts (e.g., the Apollo program).
- **Human Factors:** Designing for how people actually use things (ergonomics).
- **Sustainability:** Designing for the full lifecycle (cradle to grave).

## Applications
- **Product Design:** iPhones, Dysons.
- **Infrastructure:** Cities, transport.
- **Software:** UI/UX design.

## Criticism / Limitations
"Scope Creep" (adding features until the project is late and over budget). Over-engineering (making it too complex).
