## Overview
Civil Engineering is the oldest engineering discipline (after Military Engineering). It is the art of shaping the world to fit human needs. If you flushed a toilet, drove on a road, or drank tap water today, you thanked a Civil Engineer.

## Core Idea
The core idea is **Infrastructure**. Building the skeleton of civilization.

## Formal Definition
The design, construction, and maintenance of the physical and naturally built environment.
Sub-disciplines: **Structural**, **Geotechnical**, **Transportation**, **Environmental**.

## Intuition
-   **The Ant Hill:** Ants build complex tunnels and structures to survive. Civil Engineers do the same for humans, but with concrete and steel.
-   **Forces:** Gravity wants to pull the building down. Wind wants to push it over. The Civil Engineer fights nature to keep us safe.

## Examples
-   **The Roman Aqueducts:** Ancient civil engineering that still works today. They moved water hundreds of miles using only gravity.
-   **Burj Khalifa:** The tallest building in the world. It required new types of concrete and a "buttressed core" design to withstand desert winds.
-   **Golden Gate Bridge:** A suspension bridge that handles massive tension loads.

## Common Misconceptions
-   **It's just construction:** Engineers design it; construction workers build it. The engineer calculates the math to make sure it doesn't fall down.
-   **It's boring:** It's actually about solving massive puzzles. "How do we tunnel under a city without the buildings above collapsing?"

## Related Concepts
-   **Load:** The weight a structure must carry. (Dead Load = the building itself. Live Load = the people/furniture inside).
-   **Factor of Safety:** Building it 3x stronger than necessary, just in case.

## Applications
-   **Disaster Resilience:** Designing buildings that can survive earthquakes (Tokyo) or hurricanes (Miami).

## Criticism / Limitations
-   **Environmental Impact:** Concrete production creates 8% of global CO2 emissions. Civil Engineering is a major polluter.
