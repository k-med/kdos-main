## Overview
The ocean is a hostile environment. Salt water eats metal. Waves crush steel. Storms toss 100,000-ton ships like toys. Marine Engineers design the machines that survive this chaos. They build the ships that carry 90% of global trade.

## Core Idea
The core idea is **Buoyancy and Stability**. A ship must float (Archimedes' Principle) and it must stay upright (Center of Gravity vs. Center of Buoyancy).

## Formal Definition
The engineering of boats, ships, oil rigs, and any other marine vessel or structure.
Related Field: **Naval Architecture** (Designing the hull shape).

## Intuition
-   **The Floating City:** A cruise ship is a city with its own power plant, sewage system, and hotel, all floating on water. Marine engineers design the "guts" (engines, pumps, pipes) that keep the city running.
-   **The Metacentric Height:** The magic number that determines if a ship will roll over in a storm or pop back up like a weeble-wobble.

## Examples
-   **Container Ships:** The workhorses of globalization. Some are longer than the Empire State Building is tall.
-   **Submarines:** Spaceships underwater. They have to withstand crushing pressure (implosion) and keep the crew alive for months without air.
-   **Offshore Wind Farms:** Installing giant turbines in the middle of the sea.

## Common Misconceptions
-   **They drive the ship:** That's the Captain. The Marine Engineer is down in the engine room making sure the engine doesn't explode.

## Related Concepts
-   **Corrosion:** The enemy. Salt water is an electrolyte that turns steel into rust. Engineers use "Sacrificial Anodes" (blocks of zinc) that rust *instead* of the ship.
-   **Hydrodynamics:** Aerodynamics for water. Water is 800 times denser than air, so drag is a huge problem.

## Applications
-   **Blue Economy:** Mining the ocean floor for minerals.

## Criticism / Limitations
-   **Pollution:** Ships burn "Bunker Fuel," the dirtiest oil on earth. One ship pollutes as much as a million cars.
