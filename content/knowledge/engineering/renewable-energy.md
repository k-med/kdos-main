  Renewable energy is energy that is collected from renewable resources that are naturally replenished on a human timescale. It includes sources such as sunlight, wind, rain, tides, waves, and geothermal heat.

## Overview
We have burned dead dinosaurs (fossil fuels) for 200 years. It made us rich, but it's cooking the planet. Renewable Energy is the transition to infinite fuel sources: the sun, the wind, and the heat of the earth. It is the biggest engineering challenge of the 21st century.

## Core Idea
The core idea is **Sustainability**. Using energy that doesn't run out and doesn't destroy the biosphere.

## Formal Definition
Energy collected from renewable resources that are naturally replenished on a human timescale.
Types: **Solar**, **Wind**, **Hydro**, **Geothermal**, **Biomass**.

## Intuition
-   **The Bank Account:** Fossil fuels are like spending your savings (Capital). Once it's gone, it's gone. Renewables are like living off the interest (Income). The sun comes up every day.

## Examples
-   **Solar PV:** Turning photons directly into electrons. The price has dropped 90% in 10 years. It is now the cheapest electricity in history.
-   **Offshore Wind:** Giant turbines in the ocean where the wind is stronger and steadier.
-   **Hydroelectric:** The Hoover Dam. The original renewable. (But it hurts fish).

## Common Misconceptions
-   **It's unreliable:** "The sun doesn't always shine." True. That's why we need **Storage** (Batteries) and a **Smart Grid** to move energy from where it's windy to where it's calm.
-   **It's expensive:** It *was* expensive. Now it's cheaper than coal.

## Related Concepts
-   **Intermittency:** The main problem. Matching supply with demand when you can't control the generator.
-   **Decarbonization:** The goal. Reaching Net Zero emissions.

## Applications
-   **Electric Vehicles (EVs):** They are only "green" if the grid charging them is green.

## Criticism / Limitations
-   **Land Use:** Solar farms take up a lot of space.
-   **Materials:** We need massive amounts of Lithium, Cobalt, and Copper to build this new infrastructure.
