summary: >
  Nanotechnology, also shortened to nanotech, is the use of matter on an atomic, molecular, and supramolecular scale for industrial purposes. The earliest, widespread description of nanotechnology referred to the particular technological goal of precisely manipulating atoms and molecules for fabrication of macroscale products, also now referred to as molecular nanotechnology.

## Overview
How small is small? A nanometer is to a tennis ball what a tennis ball is to the Earth. Nanotechnology is engineering at the scale of atoms. At this scale, the rules of physics change. Gold becomes red. Carbon becomes stronger than steel. It is the frontier of the impossible.

## Core Idea
The core idea is **Bottom-Up Manufacturing**. Instead of carving a statue out of stone (Top-Down), we build it atom by atom (Bottom-Up).

## Formal Definition
The manipulation of matter on an atomic, molecular, and supramolecular scale (1 to 100 nanometers).
Famous Lecture: **"There's Plenty of Room at the Bottom"** (Richard Feynman).

## Intuition
-   **Lego:** Atoms are nature's Legos. Usually, we just use the big pre-made blocks (wood, metal). Nanotech lets us take the blocks apart and build *anything* we want. A diamond is just carbon. Pencil lead is just carbon. The only difference is how the atoms are arranged.

## Examples
-   **Graphene:** A single layer of carbon atoms. It is 200 times stronger than steel and conducts electricity better than copper.
-   **Sunscreen:** Nanoparticles of Titanium Dioxide make sunscreen transparent instead of white.
-   **Cancer Treatment:** Nanobots that swim through the blood and deliver poison directly to the tumor, leaving healthy cells alone.

## Common Misconceptions
-   **Grey Goo:** The sci-fi fear that self-replicating nanobots will eat the whole world. (We are nowhere near that level of tech).

## Related Concepts
-   **Quantum Effects:** At this scale, gravity doesn't matter, but Van der Waals forces and Quantum Tunneling do.
-   **MEMS (Micro-Electro-Mechanical Systems):** Tiny machines (like the accelerometer in your phone).

## Applications
-   **Electronics:** Making chips smaller and faster.

## Criticism / Limitations
-   **Toxicity:** Nanoparticles are so small they can pass through the skin and into the brain. We don't fully know the health risks yet.
