  Structural engineering is a sub-discipline of civil engineering in which structural engineers are trained to design the 'bones and muscles' that create the form and shape of man-made structures. Structural engineers need to understand and calculate the stability, strength and rigidity of built structures.

## Overview
Gravity never sleeps. It is always trying to pull your house down. Structural Engineers are the people who fight gravity. They design the skeleton (beams, columns) that holds a building up. If they do their job right, you never notice them. If they fail, people die.

## Core Idea
The core idea is **Equilibrium**. The forces pushing down (Gravity) must be exactly equal to the forces pushing up (Support). $\sum F = 0$.

## Formal Definition
A sub-discipline of civil engineering focused on the framework of structures.
Key Concepts: **Tension** (Pulling), **Compression** (Pushing), **Shear** (Sliding).

## Intuition
-   **The Human Body:** The skeleton is the structure. The muscles are the actuators. Without the skeleton, you would be a puddle of jelly.
-   **The Card House:** If you build a house of cards, it falls because it's unstable. Structural engineering is the math of making sure it *doesn't* fall.

## Examples
-   **Truss:** A triangle shape used in bridges. It is the strongest shape because it can't be distorted without breaking a side.
-   **Skyscrapers:** They sway in the wind. If they were too stiff, they would snap. Engineers use "Tuned Mass Dampers" (giant pendulums) to stop the swaying.

## Common Misconceptions
-   **Stronger is better:** Not always. Sometimes you want a structure to be *flexible* (like in an earthquake). If it's too rigid, it breaks.
-   **Architects do this:** Architects design how it *looks*. Structural Engineers design how it *stands*.

## Related Concepts
-   **Material Science:** Knowing that Steel is good for Tension and Concrete is good for Compression. (Reinforced Concrete combines both).
-   **Fatigue:** When a material gets tired from being bent back and forth millions of times (like a paperclip) and suddenly snaps.

## Applications
-   **Space Station:** Structural engineering in zero gravity. You don't have to fight weight, but you have to fight pressure (keeping the air inside).

## Criticism / Limitations
-   **Cost:** You can build anything if you have infinite money. The trick is building it safely *and* cheaply.
