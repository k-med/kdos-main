  Mining engineering is an engineering discipline that applies science and technology to the extraction of minerals from the earth. Mining engineering is associated with many other disciplines, such as mineral processing, exploration, excavation, geology, and metallurgy, geotechnical engineering and surveying.

## Overview
"If it can't be grown, it has to be mined." Your phone, your car, your house—it all starts as rock in the ground. Mining Engineers figure out how to get that rock out safely and profitably. It is the foundation of the industrial economy.

## Core Idea
The core idea is **Excavation**. Moving massive amounts of earth to find tiny amounts of treasure.

## Formal Definition
The discipline that applies science and technology to the extraction of minerals from the earth.
Types: **Surface Mining** (Open Pit) and **Underground Mining**.

## Intuition
-   **The Needle in the Haystack:** Gold ore might contain only 5 grams of gold per ton of rock. You have to crush the whole ton to get the 5 grams.
-   **The Ant Farm:** Underground mines are complex cities with ventilation, power, and transport systems miles below the surface.

## Examples
-   **Bingham Canyon Mine:** The deepest hole ever dug by man (0.75 miles deep). It produces copper.
-   **Lithium Mining:** The new gold rush. Extracting lithium from brine pools in the desert for EV batteries.

## Common Misconceptions
-   **It's low tech:** Modern mines use autonomous trucks the size of houses, drones for mapping, and AI for exploration.
-   **It's just digging:** It's mostly about **Rock Mechanics** (making sure the tunnel doesn't collapse) and **Ventilation** (making sure the miners can breathe).

## Related Concepts
-   **Reclamation:** Putting the land back together after the mine closes. Planting trees, turning pits into lakes.
-   **Mineral Processing:** Crushing and chemical treatment to separate the metal from the waste rock (Tailings).

## Applications
-   **Space Mining:** Asteroid mining is the future. One asteroid could contain more platinum than has ever been mined on Earth.

## Criticism / Limitations
-   **Environment:** Mining is inherently destructive. It destroys landscapes and creates toxic waste (Acid Mine Drainage).
