summary: >
  Structural analysis is the determination of the effects of loads on physical structures and their components. Structures subject to this type of analysis include all that must withstand loads, such as buildings, bridges, vehicles, machinery, furniture, attire, soil strata, prostheses and biological tissue.

## Overview
Will it stand up? Structural analysis ensures that bridges don't collapse and skyscrapers don't topple in the wind. It's the math of safety.

## Core Idea
**Equilibrium:** The sum of all forces and moments (twisting forces) on a structure must be zero. If they aren't zero, the structure is moving (accelerating).

## Formal Definition (if applicable)
**Stress:** Force per unit area ($\sigma = F/A$).
**Strain:** Deformation per unit length ($\epsilon = \Delta L / L$).

## Intuition
- **Tension:** Pulling apart (rope).
- **Compression:** Pushing together (column).
- **Shear:** Sliding past (scissors).
- **Bending:** A mix of tension and compression (diving board).

## Examples
- **Truss:** A framework of triangles (very strong and light). Used in bridges and roofs.
- **Beam:** A horizontal member carrying vertical loads.
- **Arch:** Converts vertical loads into compression (Romans loved these).

## Common Misconceptions
- "Rigid is better." (Buildings need to be flexible to survive earthquakes. The swaying is intentional.)
- "Concrete is strong." (It's strong in compression but weak in tension. That's why we put steel bars inside—Reinforced Concrete.)

## Related Concepts
- **Factor of Safety:** Designing a bridge to hold 2x the expected load, just in case.
- **Finite Element Analysis (FEA):** Using computers to simulate stress on complex shapes.
- **Buckling:** When a column suddenly bows out and fails under compression.

## Applications
- **Civil Engineering:** Buildings, dams, tunnels.
- **Mechanical Engineering:** Car chassis, crane booms.
- **Aerospace:** Airplane wings.

## Criticism / Limitations
Models are only as good as the assumptions. If you underestimate the wind load or the soil strength, the math won't save you (e.g., Tacoma Narrows Bridge).
