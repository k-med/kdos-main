## Overview
Light is information. Optical Engineers manipulate light to see the invisible (Microscopes), look back in time (Telescopes), and connect the world (Fiber Optics). They are the masters of photons.

## Core Idea
The core idea is **Refraction and Reflection**. Bending light to do what we want.

## Formal Definition
The field encompassing the generation, transmission, manipulation, detection, and utilization of light.
Key Technologies: **Lasers**, **Lenses**, **Fiber Optics**.

## Intuition
-   **The Pipe:** Fiber optic cables are pipes for light. You shine a laser in one end, and it bounces down the glass tube for miles without losing brightness. This is how the internet works.
-   **The Scalpel:** A laser is a knife made of light. It can cut steel or perform eye surgery (LASIK) with perfect precision.

## Examples
-   **James Webb Telescope:** An engineering miracle. Unfolding a giant gold mirror in space to see the first stars.
-   **Lithography:** Using light to "print" circuits on silicon chips. The light has to be so precise (Extreme Ultraviolet) that it's almost impossible to generate.
-   **Cameras:** From the lens in your eye to the sensor in your phone.

## Common Misconceptions
-   **It's just making glasses:** That's Optometry. Optical Engineering is designing the laser guidance system for a missile or the hologram for a VR headset.

## Related Concepts
-   **Photonics:** The electronics of light. Using photons instead of electrons to build computers.
-   **Spectroscopy:** Identifying chemicals by the color of light they absorb.

## Applications
-   **LIDAR:** Laser Radar. Self-driving cars use it to "see" the world in 3D.

## Criticism / Limitations
-   **Diffraction Limit:** You can't focus light smaller than its wavelength. This limits how small we can make chips.
