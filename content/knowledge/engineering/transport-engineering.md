  Transportation engineering or transport engineering is the application of technology and scientific principles to the planning, functional design, operation and management of facilities for any mode of transportation in order to provide for the safe, efficient, rapid, comfortable, convenient, economical, and environmentally compatible movement of people and goods.

## Overview
Traffic jams are not inevitable. They are a math problem. Transport Engineers design the veins and arteries of the city. They decide where the roads go, how long the light stays green, and how to move a million people to work every morning without gridlock.

## Core Idea
The core idea is **Flow**. Treating cars like fluid in a pipe.

## Formal Definition
The application of technology and scientific principles to the planning, functional design, operation, and management of facilities for any mode of transportation.
Subfields: **Traffic Engineering**, **Highway Engineering**, **Public Transport**.

## Intuition
-   **The Funnel:** If you have 4 lanes merging into 2, you get a bottleneck. Transport engineers try to widen the funnel or slow down the flow *before* the bottleneck (Ramp Meters).
-   **Induced Demand:** If you build more roads, traffic gets *worse*. Why? Because more people decide to drive. (Braess's Paradox).

## Examples
-   **Roundabouts:** They are safer and more efficient than 4-way stops (because cars don't have to stop completely), but Americans hate them.
-   **High-Speed Rail:** Moving people at 200mph. It requires tracks that are perfectly straight and flat.
-   **Bus Rapid Transit (BRT):** A subway on wheels. Buses with their own dedicated lanes.

## Common Misconceptions
-   **More lanes = Less traffic:** Almost never true in the long run. The only way to reduce traffic is congestion pricing or better public transit.

## Related Concepts
-   **Modal Split:** The percentage of people who drive vs. walk vs. take the bus. Engineers try to shift the split away from cars.
-   **Last Mile Problem:** The train gets you to the station, but how do you get to your house? (Scooters, Bikes).

## Applications
-   **Smart Cities:** Traffic lights that talk to cars and turn green when you approach.

## Criticism / Limitations
-   **Car-Centric:** For 70 years, we designed cities for cars, not people. This destroyed neighborhoods and made us fat. Modern transport engineering is trying to fix this (Complete Streets).
