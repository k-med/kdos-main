## Overview
CSI for buildings. When a bridge collapses, a car crashes, or a phone battery explodes, Forensic Engineers are called in to figure out *why*. They work backwards from the disaster to find the truth.

## Core Idea
The core idea is **The Smoking Gun**. Finding the physical evidence that proves what happened.
-   "Was it a design flaw?"
-   "Was it bad maintenance?"
-   "Was it user error?"

## Formal Definition
The investigation of failures which may lead to legal activity.
Key Process: **Reverse Engineering the Accident**.

## Intuition
-   **The Puzzle:** You have a pile of twisted metal. You have to put it back together mentally to see how it broke.
-   **The Witness:** Metal doesn't lie. If a beam is bent a certain way, it tells you exactly how much force hit it and from what direction.

## Examples
-   **9/11 Investigation:** Forensic engineers studied the steel from the Twin Towers to understand how the fire weakened the structure enough to cause a collapse.
-   **Hyatt Regency Walkway Collapse:** The deadliest structural failure in US history. Engineers found a tiny change in the design of a connection rod that doubled the load on a nut.
-   **Samsung Galaxy Note 7:** Why were phones exploding? Forensic engineers found that the battery was slightly too big for the case, causing it to pinch and short circuit.

## Common Misconceptions
-   **It's just guessing:** It involves rigorous testing and computer simulation to prove the theory.
-   **They are lawyers:** They are engineers who testify in court as "Expert Witnesses."

## Related Concepts
-   **Standard of Care:** Did the original engineer do what a "reasonable" engineer would have done? If not, it's Negligence.
-   **Subrogation:** Insurance companies hiring engineers to prove it was someone else's fault so they can get their money back.

## Applications
-   **Product Liability:** Suing a car company because the airbag didn't deploy.

## Criticism / Limitations
-   **Hindsight Bias:** It's easy to see the mistake *after* the accident. It's hard to see it before.
