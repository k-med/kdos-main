  Biomedical engineering (BME) or medical engineering is the application of engineering principles and design concepts to medicine and biology for healthcare purposes (e.g., diagnostic or therapeutic). BME is also traditionally known as "bioengineering", but this term has come to refer to biological engineering.

## Overview
Doctors heal people. Engineers build machines. Biomedical Engineers build machines *that* heal people. From the pacemaker keeping a heart beating to the MRI machine scanning a brain, they combine the precision of engineering with the messiness of biology.

## Core Idea
The core idea is **The Body as a Machine**. If the heart is a pump, we can fix it like a pump. If the arm is a lever, we can replace it with a lever.

## Formal Definition
The application of engineering principles and design concepts to medicine and biology for healthcare purposes.
Subfields: **Biomechanics**, **Biomaterials**, **Tissue Engineering**.

## Intuition
-   **The Cyborg:** We are slowly becoming cyborgs. Glasses, hearing aids, and hip replacements are all biomedical engineering. We are integrating technology into our biology to live longer.

## Examples
-   **Pacemaker:** A tiny computer implanted in the chest that shocks the heart if it stops.
-   **Artificial Kidney (Dialysis):** A machine that filters blood when the kidneys fail.
-   **Tissue Engineering:** Growing a new ear in a lab using the patient's own cells. (Sci-fi becoming reality).

## Common Misconceptions
-   **They are doctors:** They usually don't treat patients directly. They design the tools the doctors use.
-   **It's just prosthetics:** It's also about software (analyzing DNA) and materials (designing a screw that won't rust inside the body).

## Related Concepts
-   **Biocompatibility:** The most important rule. The body hates foreign objects (Immune System). You have to trick the body into accepting the titanium screw.
-   **Neuralink:** Interfacing the brain directly with a computer. The ultimate biomedical engineering project.

## Applications
-   **CRISPR:** Engineering the code of life itself.

## Criticism / Limitations
-   **Ethics:** Just because we *can* enhance humans, should we? (Designer Babies).
