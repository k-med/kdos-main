## Overview
If it moves, a Mechanical Engineer probably designed it. From the tiny gears in a watch to the massive turbines in a power plant, Mechanical Engineering is the study of motion and energy. It is the "Jack of all Trades" of engineering.

## Core Idea
The core idea is **Mechanics**. Using physics (Force, Energy, Motion) to do useful work.

## Formal Definition
The branch of engineering that deals with the design, construction, and use of machines.
Key Concepts: **Thermodynamics**, **Fluid Dynamics**, **Kinematics**.

## Intuition
-   **The Lever:** The simplest machine. Give me a lever long enough, and I can move the world (Archimedes). Mechanical engineering is just combining levers, gears, and springs to multiply force.
-   **The Engine:** Turning heat (fire) into motion (spinning wheels). This is the heart of the Industrial Revolution.

## Examples
-   **Internal Combustion Engine:** The machine that changed the world. It explodes gas to push a piston.
-   **HVAC:** Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning. Making indoor life bearable.
-   **Robotics:** The modern frontier. Combining mechanical bodies with electronic brains.

## Common Misconceptions
-   **They are mechanics:** A mechanic *fixes* cars. A mechanical engineer *designs* cars.
-   **It's old fashioned:** It's evolving. Now it involves 3D printing, nanotechnology, and biomechanics.

## Related Concepts
-   **CAD (Computer-Aided Design):** Drawing machines in 3D on a computer before building them.
-   **Finite Element Analysis (FEA):** Simulating stress on a part to see where it will break.

## Applications
-   **Prosthetics:** Designing artificial limbs that move like real ones.

## Criticism / Limitations
-   **Efficiency:** We are hitting the limits of how efficient heat engines can be (Carnot Limit). We need new physics to go further.
