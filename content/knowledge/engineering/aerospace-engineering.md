## Overview
"It's not rocket science." Well, this *is* rocket science. Aerospace Engineering is the design of things that fly. It is the most demanding field of engineering because gravity is unforgiving. If a bridge fails, it cracks. If a plane fails, it falls.

## Core Idea
The core idea is **Defying Gravity**. Using lift and thrust to overcome weight and drag.

## Formal Definition
The primary field of engineering concerned with the development of aircraft and spacecraft.
Branches: **Aeronautical** (in atmosphere) and **Astronautical** (in space).

## Intuition
-   **The Balance:** Every plane is a fight between 4 forces: Lift vs. Weight, Thrust vs. Drag. The engineer tries to maximize Lift/Thrust and minimize Weight/Drag.
-   **Weight is the Enemy:** Every ounce matters. That's why planes are made of aluminum and carbon fiber, not steel.

## Examples
-   **Wright Brothers:** The first aeronautical engineers. They built their own wind tunnel to test wing shapes.
-   **Apollo 11:** The greatest engineering feat in history. Putting a man on the moon with less computing power than a calculator.
-   **SpaceX:** Reusable rockets. Landing a booster vertically is a masterpiece of control theory.

## Common Misconceptions
-   **Bernoulli's Principle explains lift:** It's only half the story. Newton's Third Law (pushing air down pushes the wing up) is the other half.
-   **Space is far away:** Space is only 62 miles up (The Kármán Line). The hard part isn't getting *high*; it's going *fast* enough (17,500 mph) to stay in orbit.

## Related Concepts
-   **Aerodynamics:** How air flows around objects. (Streamlining).
-   **Propulsion:** Jet engines and rocket motors.

## Applications
-   **Drones:** Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) are changing war and delivery.

## Criticism / Limitations
-   **Cost:** Space travel is incredibly expensive.
-   **Supersonic Flight:** We had it (Concorde) and lost it because of the sonic boom and fuel costs.
