## Overview
Civil Engineers build the body of the world; Electrical Engineers build the nervous system. They control the flow of electrons to power our cities and process our information. It is the magic behind the lightbulb and the iPhone.

## Core Idea
The core idea is **Controlling Electrons**.
-   **Power:** Moving lots of electrons to do work (turn a motor, light a lamp).
-   **Information:** Moving a few electrons to send a signal (1s and 0s).

## Formal Definition
The study, design, and application of equipment, devices, and systems which use electricity, electronics, and electromagnetism.
Subfields: **Power**, **Electronics**, **Telecommunications**, **Signal Processing**.

## Intuition
-   **Water Analogy:**
    -   **Voltage:** Water Pressure.
    -   **Current:** Water Flow.
    -   **Resistance:** A narrow pipe.
    -   Electrical Engineering is plumbing for electrons.

## Examples
-   **The Grid:** The most complex machine ever built. Connecting every power plant to every outlet in the country.
-   **Transistor:** The tiny switch that makes computers possible. A modern chip has billions of them.
-   **Radio:** Turning sound into invisible electromagnetic waves and catching them with an antenna.

## Common Misconceptions
-   **It's just wiring houses:** That's an electrician. An electrical engineer designs the grid, the microchip, or the satellite.
-   **Electricity travels at light speed:** The *signal* travels near light speed, but the electrons themselves move very slowly (Drift Velocity).

## Related Concepts
-   **Ohm's Law:** $V = IR$. The fundamental equation.
-   **AC vs. DC:** Alternating Current (Tesla/Westinghouse) for the grid. Direct Current (Edison) for batteries/electronics.

## Applications
-   **Renewable Energy:** Designing solar panels and wind turbines to feed the grid.

## Criticism / Limitations
-   **Moore's Law:** We are shrinking transistors so much that quantum physics is starting to interfere. The "Free Lunch" of faster computers is ending.
