## Overview
You can build the strongest castle in the world, but if you build it on a swamp, it will sink. Geotechnical Engineers study the dirt. They make sure the ground is strong enough to hold the building. They are the only engineers who deal with materials they didn't choose (nature provided the soil).

## Core Idea
The core idea is **Soil Mechanics**. Dirt isn't just dirt. It's a complex mixture of solids, water, and air. It behaves like a solid sometimes and a liquid other times.

## Formal Definition
The branch of civil engineering concerned with the engineering behavior of earth materials.
Key Concepts: **Bearing Capacity**, **Settlement**, **Liquefaction**.

## Intuition
-   **The Sandcastle:** Wet sand is strong (you can build a tower). Dry sand is weak (it flows). Too much water (waves) and it turns to soup. Geotechnical engineers manage the water in the soil.
-   **Leaning Tower of Pisa:** The most famous geotechnical failure in history. The soil on one side was softer than the other.

## Examples
-   **Foundations:** The feet of the building.
    -   **Shallow:** Concrete slab (for houses).
    -   **Deep:** Piles driven 100 feet down to hit bedrock (for skyscrapers).
-   **Dams:** Making sure the water doesn't leak *under* the dam and wash it away.

## Common Misconceptions
-   **Rock is solid:** Rock has cracks (fissures). If you build a tunnel, the rock can slide along those cracks.

## Related Concepts
-   **Liquefaction:** During an earthquake, shaking can turn solid ground into quicksand. Buildings just tip over. This happened in Japan and New Zealand.
-   **Retaining Walls:** Walls that hold back a hill (preventing landslides).

## Applications
-   **Offshore Oil Rigs:** Anchoring a giant platform to the bottom of the ocean.

## Criticism / Limitations
-   **Uncertainty:** You can't X-ray the entire ground. You drill a few holes and guess what's in between. It's an art as much as a science.
