## Overview
It's the study of energy. How to move it, how to store it, and why you can't ever break even. It governs everything from car engines to black holes.

## Core Idea
**Entropy:** A measure of disorder. The Second Law of Thermodynamics states that the total entropy of an isolated system can never decrease over time. Things naturally fall apart; they don't naturally come together.

## Formal Definition (if applicable)
**First Law of Thermodynamics:** Energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transformed. $\Delta U = Q - W$ (Change in internal energy = Heat added - Work done).

## Intuition
- **First Law:** You can't win. (Energy is conserved).
- **Second Law:** You can't break even. (You always lose some energy to heat/entropy).
- **Third Law:** You can't get out of the game. (You can't reach absolute zero).

## Examples
- **Heat Engine:** Converting heat into work (e.g., a steam engine or internal combustion engine).
- **Refrigerator:** Using work to move heat from a cold place to a hot place (fighting nature).
- **Perpetual Motion Machine:** Impossible because of the laws of thermodynamics.

## Common Misconceptions
- "Heat rises." (Hot air rises because it is less dense. Heat itself radiates in all directions.)
- "Entropy is just 'messiness'." (It's more accurately about the number of possible microscopic configurations a system can have.)

## Related Concepts
- **Enthalpy:** Total heat content of a system.
- **Carnot Cycle:** The theoretical most efficient heat engine possible.
- **Heat Transfer:** Conduction, Convection, Radiation.

## Applications
- **Power Plants:** Generating electricity.
- **HVAC:** Heating and cooling buildings.
- **Chemical Engineering:** Designing reactors.

## Criticism / Limitations
Classical thermodynamics deals with macroscopic systems in equilibrium. It doesn't describe microscopic details or non-equilibrium states well (requires Statistical Mechanics).
