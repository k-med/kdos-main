## Overview
Programming is art. Software Engineering is... engineering. It's not just writing code; it's building systems that are reliable, scalable, and maintainable. It's the difference between building a doghouse (hacking) and building a skyscraper (engineering).

## Core Idea
The core idea is **Managing Complexity**. Software is the most complex thing humans have ever built. Windows 10 has 50 million lines of code. No single human can understand it all.

## Formal Definition
The systematic application of engineering approaches to the development of software.
Key Concepts: **SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle)**, **Version Control**, **Testing**.

## Intuition
-   **The Bridge:** If you build a bridge, you can't change it later.
-   **The Code:** Software is "Soft." You can change it forever. This is a blessing (Updates) and a curse (Bugs). Software Engineering is the discipline of changing it without breaking it.

## Examples
-   **Apollo 11:** Margaret Hamilton coined the term "Software Engineering" to describe the rigorous process needed to write the code that landed on the moon.
-   **Agile vs. Waterfall:**
    -   **Waterfall:** Plan everything, then build. (Like construction).
    -   **Agile:** Build a little, test, repeat. (Better for software).

## Common Misconceptions
-   **It's just coding:** Coding is only 20% of the job. The rest is design, testing, meetings, and debugging.
-   **It's easy:** "It's just typing." It's actually pure logic. One missing semicolon can crash a billion-dollar rocket.

## Related Concepts
-   **Technical Debt:** Taking a shortcut now (hacking it) means you have to pay "interest" later (fixing the mess).
-   **Refactoring:** Cleaning up the code without changing what it does.

## Applications
-   **Everything:** "Software is eating the world." (Marc Andreessen). Every company is now a software company.

## Criticism / Limitations
-   **Reliability:** We accept bugs in software that we would never accept in a car or a bridge. "Move fast and break things" is dangerous when software controls cars and hospitals.
