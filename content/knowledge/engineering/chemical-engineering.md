## Overview
A chemist discovers a new medicine in a beaker (1 gram). A Chemical Engineer figures out how to make 10 tons of it in a factory. They are the bridge between the lab and the market. They turn raw materials (oil, rocks, air) into useful products (plastic, fuel, fertilizer).

## Core Idea
The core idea is **Scale-Up**. Making something work in a test tube is easy. Making it work in a giant reactor at 500 degrees with high pressure is hard.

## Formal Definition
The branch of engineering that deals with chemical production and the manufacture of products through chemical processes.
Key Concept: **Unit Operations** (Distillation, Filtration, Crystallization).

## Intuition
-   **The Chef:** A chemist invents a recipe. A chemical engineer designs the factory to mass-produce the cookies. They worry about heating the oven evenly, mixing the dough efficiently, and not blowing up the kitchen.

## Examples
-   **Haber-Bosch Process:** Turning nitrogen from the air into fertilizer. It feeds half the world's population. Without it, billions would starve.
-   **Oil Refining:** Separating crude oil into gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel using a giant distillation column.
-   **Plastics:** Turning oil into the material that makes everything from water bottles to heart valves.

## Common Misconceptions
-   **They are just chemists:** Chemists study *reactions*. Chemical Engineers study *processes* (Heat Transfer, Mass Transfer, Fluid Flow).
-   **It's dirty:** Modern chemical engineering is heavily focused on "Green Engineering"—reducing waste and pollution.

## Related Concepts
-   **Process Control:** Using sensors and computers to keep the factory running safely.
-   **Thermodynamics:** Understanding energy is crucial. (Exothermic reactions release heat; if you don't cool them, they explode).

## Applications
-   **Batteries:** Designing better lithium-ion batteries for electric cars.

## Criticism / Limitations
-   **Pollution:** Chemical engineering created plastics and "forever chemicals" (PFAS) that are now polluting the planet.
