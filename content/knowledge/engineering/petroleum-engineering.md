  Petroleum engineering is a field of engineering concerned with the activities related to the production of Hydrocarbons, which can be either crude oil or natural gas. Exploration and production are deemed to fall within the upstream sector of the oil and gas industry.

## Overview
The world runs on oil. Petroleum Engineers are the ones who find it and get it out of the ground. They drill holes 5 miles deep into the earth to hit a target the size of a swimming pool. It is high-stakes, high-tech, and high-pay.

## Core Idea
The core idea is **Flow through Porous Media**. Oil isn't in a big underground lake. It's trapped inside solid rock (like water in a sponge). You have to squeeze it out.

## Formal Definition
The field of engineering concerned with the production of hydrocarbons (oil and gas).
Subfields: **Drilling**, **Reservoir**, **Production**.

## Intuition
-   **The Straw:** Drilling a well is like sticking a straw into a juice box. If the pressure is high, the juice shoots out (Gusher). If the pressure is low, you have to suck (Pumpjack).
-   **Fracking:** If the rock is too tight (Shale), the oil can't flow. So you break the rock with high-pressure water to create cracks for the oil to escape.

## Examples
-   **Deepwater Horizon:** Drilling in 5,000 feet of water. An engineering marvel that turned into a disaster.
-   **Horizontal Drilling:** Turning the drill bit 90 degrees underground to follow a thin layer of oil for miles.

## Common Misconceptions
-   **We are running out of oil:** "Peak Oil" has been predicted for 50 years. But engineers keep inventing new ways to get oil we couldn't reach before (like Fracking). The limit isn't geology; it's climate change.

## Related Concepts
-   **EOR (Enhanced Oil Recovery):** Injecting steam or CO2 to wash the last drops of oil out of the rock.
-   **Upstream vs. Downstream:** Upstream = Getting it out of the ground (Petroleum Engineering). Downstream = Refining it (Chemical Engineering).

## Applications
-   **Geothermal:** Using drilling tech to get heat from the earth instead of oil.

## Criticism / Limitations
-   **Climate Change:** Petroleum Engineers are brilliant at doing something that is destroying the planet. It is an ethical crisis for the field.
