  Nuclear engineering is the branch of engineering concerned with the application of breaking down atomic nuclei (fission) or of combining atomic nuclei (fusion), or with the application of other sub-atomic processes based on the principles of nuclear physics.

## Overview
Splitting an atom releases a terrifying amount of energy. Nuclear Engineers are the people who tame that energy. They design reactors that power cities and submarines. They also design the machines that treat cancer with radiation. It is the most powerful and controversial branch of engineering.

## Core Idea
The core idea is **E=mc²**. A tiny amount of mass can be converted into a huge amount of energy. One pellet of uranium = 1 ton of coal.

## Formal Definition
The branch of engineering concerned with the application of nuclear fission and fusion.
Key Concepts: **Criticality**, **Half-Life**, **Shielding**.

## Intuition
-   **The Kettle:** A nuclear reactor is just a fancy way to boil water. The uranium gets hot, boils water, makes steam, turns a turbine. The engineering challenge is keeping it from getting *too* hot (Meltdown).

## Examples
-   **Fission:** Splitting big atoms (Uranium). This is what all current nuclear power plants use.
-   **Fusion:** Smashing small atoms (Hydrogen) together. This is what the sun does. It is the "Holy Grail" of energy (infinite, clean), but we haven't figured out how to build a commercial reactor yet. (ITER).

## Common Misconceptions
-   **It's unsafe:** Statistically, nuclear is the safest form of energy (fewer deaths per kWh than coal, oil, or even solar/wind if you count installation accidents). But when it fails (Chernobyl), it fails spectacularly.
-   **Nuclear Waste lasts forever:** It lasts a long time, but the volume is tiny. All the waste from the US nuclear industry since the 1950s would fit on a single football field.

## Related Concepts
-   **Radiation Shielding:** Using lead and concrete to stop invisible bullets (Gamma Rays).
-   **Proliferation:** The fear that peaceful nuclear tech will be used to make bombs.

## Applications
-   **Medical Imaging:** PET scans and X-rays rely on nuclear physics.

## Criticism / Limitations
-   **Public Perception:** People are terrified of radiation. This makes building new plants politically difficult and expensive.
