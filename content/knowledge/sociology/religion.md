## Overview
**Religion** is a universal social institution. Sociologists don't ask if God exists; they ask *why* people believe and what that belief *does* to society.

## Core Idea
The core idea is **social cohesion**. Religion binds people together (religare = to bind).

## Formal Definition
A unified system of beliefs and practices relative to sacred things, which unite into one single moral community called a Church (Durkheim).

## Intuition
-   **Sacred vs. Profane:** The world is divided into the holy (Bible, Flag) and the everyday (Phone, Shoe).
-   **Opium of the People (Marx):** Religion comforts the poor ("The meek shall inherit the earth") so they don't revolt against the rich.
-   **Protestant Ethic (Weber):** Calvinist beliefs (hard work = sign of salvation) created Capitalism.

## Examples
-   **Rituals:** Baptism, Prayer, Fasting. Shared actions create shared feelings (Collective Effervescence).
-   **Secularization:** The theory that as science advances, religion will die. (Hasn't really happened; religion is changing, not disappearing).
-   **Fundamentalism:** A reaction against modernity. Returning to the "fundamentals" of the faith.

## Common Misconceptions
-   **Misconception:** Religion is just irrational superstition.
    -   **Correction:** It serves rational social functions (community, meaning, charity).
-   **Misconception:** Cults are different from religions.
    -   **Correction:** A cult is just a new religion with no power. "A religion is a cult with an army."

## Related Concepts
-   **[Theology](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/theology/theology.md):** The study of God (internal). Sociology studies the *people* (external).
-   **[Mythology](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/mythology/mythology.md):** The stories of religion.
-   **[Civil Religion](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/sociology/civil-religion.md):** Patriotism as religion (The Constitution as scripture).

## Applications
-   **Politics:** The Religious Right.
-   **Conflict:** Religious wars.

## Criticism and Limitations
-   **Conflict Theory:** Religion often justifies violence and oppression (Crusades, Caste System).
