## Overview
**Social Stratification** is the layering of society. Like rock strata, people are arranged in layers. Some are on top (Elite), and some are on the bottom (Underclass).

## Core Idea
The core idea is **inequality**. Resources (Money, Power, Prestige) are not distributed equally. This structure is built into the system, not just a result of individual effort.

## Formal Definition
A system by which a society ranks categories of people in a hierarchy.
-   **Closed System:** Caste (born into it, can't move).
-   **Open System:** Class (based on achievement, allows mobility).

## Intuition
-   **The Ladder:** Can you climb it? (Social Mobility). In the US, the ladder is getting harder to climb.
-   **Marx:** It's all about relationship to production. Owners (Bourgeoisie) vs. Workers (Proletariat).
-   **Weber:** It's more complex. Class (Money), Status (Prestige), and Party (Power). A drug dealer has Class but low Status. A priest has Status but low Class.

## Examples
-   **The 1%:** The concentration of wealth at the very top.
-   **Poverty:** Not just lack of money, but lack of access to healthcare, education, and power.
-   **Meritocracy:** The ideal that the best rise to the top. Sociologists argue this is often a myth used to justify inequality.

## Common Misconceptions
-   **Misconception:** Poor people are lazy.
    -   **Correction:** Structural explanations (bad schools, lack of jobs) explain poverty better than individual traits.
-   **Misconception:** Inequality is natural.
    -   **Correction:** Hunter-gatherer societies were egalitarian. Stratification is a choice of civilization.

## Related Concepts
-   **[Social Mobility](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/sociology/social-mobility.md):** Moving up or down.
-   **[Intersectionality](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/sociology/intersectionality.md):** How class overlaps with race and gender.
-   **[Global Stratification](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/sociology/global-stratification.md):** Rich nations vs. Poor nations.

## Applications
-   **Tax Policy:** Redistribution of wealth.
-   **Education:** Trying to level the playing field.

## Criticism and Limitations
-   **Davis-Moore Thesis:** Functionalists argue inequality is good because it motivates the most talented people to do the hardest jobs (like being a surgeon).
