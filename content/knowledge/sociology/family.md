## Overview
**Family** is the basic unit of society. It is where we are first socialized, loved, and messed up.

## Core Idea
The core idea is **function**. Families serve vital needs: reproduction, protection, socialization, and emotional support.

## Formal Definition
A social institution found in all societies that unites people in cooperative groups to care for one another, including any children.
-   **Nuclear Family:** Mom, Dad, Kids. (A modern invention).
-   **Extended Family:** Grandparents, Cousins, Aunts. (The historical norm).

## Intuition
-   **The Factory of Personality:** Your family builds you. (Freud was right about this).
-   **Changing Definitions:** From "Economic Unit" (farm labor) to "Emotional Unit" (soulmates).

## Examples
-   **Divorce:** High rates in the West. Is it a sign of failure or freedom?
-   **Same-Sex Marriage:** Redefining family based on love rather than gender.
-   **The Sandwich Generation:** Adults caring for their children and their aging parents at the same time.

## Common Misconceptions
-   **Misconception:** The "Traditional Family" (1950s) is the natural state.
    -   **Correction:** The 1950s nuclear family was a historical anomaly caused by post-war prosperity. Throughout history, families were messy, extended, and often broken by death.
-   **Misconception:** Family is private.
    -   **Correction:** The state regulates it heavily (Marriage licenses, CPS).
