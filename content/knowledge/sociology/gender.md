## Overview
**Gender** is the social performance of being male or female. It is distinct from biological **sex**.

## Core Idea
The core idea is **performativity**. "One is not born, but rather becomes, a woman" (Simone de Beauvoir). We "do" gender every day through our clothes, speech, and behavior.

## Formal Definition
-   **Sex:** Biological differences (Chromosomes, Hormones).
-   **Gender:** Social and cultural significance attached to those differences.

## Intuition
-   **Pink vs. Blue:** 100 years ago, pink was for boys (strong color) and blue for girls (dainty). Society flipped it. This proves gender norms are arbitrary.
-   **Patriarchy:** A social system where men hold primary power.

## Examples
-   **The Pay Gap:** Women earning less than men for similar work (or being steered into lower-paying fields).
-   **Toxic Masculinity:** Cultural norms that harm men (suppressing emotions, violence).
-   **Non-Binary:** Rejecting the strict male/female binary.

## Common Misconceptions
-   **Misconception:** Gender is determined by biology.
    -   **Correction:** Biology plays a role, but culture amplifies and enforces it.
-   **Misconception:** Feminism is about hating men.
    -   **Correction:** It is the belief in the social, political, and economic equality of the sexes.

-   **[Family](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/sociology/family.md):** The primary site of gender socialization.

## Applications
-   **Law:** Title IX (Gender equality in education).
-   **Workplace:** Parental leave policies.

## Criticism and Limitations
-   **Biological Essentialism:** The counter-argument that men and women are fundamentally wired differently (Evolutionary Psychology).
