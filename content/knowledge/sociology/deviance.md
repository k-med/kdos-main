## Overview
**Deviance** is breaking the rules. It's not just crime; it's anything that makes you an outsider. It defines the boundaries of "normal."

## Core Idea
The core idea is **relativity**. Nothing is inherently deviant. It is only deviant because society labels it so. (Killing is bad, unless it's war. Nudity is bad, unless it's a locker room).

## Formal Definition
Behavior that violates the standards of conduct or expectations of a group or society.
-   **Formal Deviance:** Crime (breaking laws).
-   **Informal Deviance:** Being weird (breaking folkways).

## Intuition
-   **Labeling Theory:** Deviance is not in the act, but in the reaction. If a rich kid steals, it's a "prank." If a poor kid steals, it's "crime." The label sticks and becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy.
-   **Durkheim:** Deviance is necessary. It unites the group ("Us vs. Him") and clarifies moral boundaries.

## Examples
-   **Stigma (Goffman):** A "spoiled identity." Being an ex-convict, mentally ill, or physically disabled can be a stigma that excludes you from normal interaction.
-   **Strain Theory (Merton):** People become deviant when they can't achieve society's goals (money) through legal means (work), so they innovate (deal drugs).

## Common Misconceptions
-   **Misconception:** Deviants are bad people.
    -   **Correction:** Jesus, Gandhi, and MLK were all deviants in their time. Deviance leads to social change.
-   **Misconception:** Deviance is rare.
    -   **Correction:** Everyone is deviant sometimes (speeding, lying).

## Related Concepts
-   **[Social Control](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/sociology/social-control.md):** How society enforces norms (Police, Gossip).
-   **[Criminology](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/law/criminal-law.md):** The study of crime.
-   **[Anomie](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/sociology/anomie.md):** Normlessness. When rules break down, deviance spikes.

## Applications
-   **Criminal Justice:** Understanding why people commit crimes helps prevent them.
-   **Civil Rights:** Fighting to de-stigmatize behaviors (like homosexuality).

## Criticism and Limitations
-   **Power:** Who gets to define what is deviant? Usually the rich and powerful.
