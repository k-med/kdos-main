## Overview
**Education** is the great equalizer... or the great divider. It is how society passes on knowledge, but also how it reproduces inequality.

## Core Idea
The core idea is **sorting**. Schools sort children into "winners" and "losers" (College track vs. Vocational track).

## Formal Definition
The social institution for transmitting knowledge and skills, as well as cultural norms and values.

## Intuition
-   **The Elevator:** Education is supposed to lift you up (Social Mobility).
-   **The Gatekeeper:** It keeps people out (Credentialism). You need a degree just to get an interview.

## Examples
-   **Hidden Curriculum:** What you learn besides math. (Obedience, punctuality, patriotism).
-   **Tracking:** Putting smart kids in AP classes and others in remedial. Often correlates with race/class.
-   **Savage Inequalities (Kozol):** Rich schools have iPads; poor schools have leaking roofs. Funding is often based on local property taxes.

## Common Misconceptions
-   **Misconception:** Schools are meritocratic.
    -   **Correction:** Family background is a stronger predictor of success than IQ. Rich kids get tutors; poor kids get jobs.
-   **Misconception:** More education is always better.
    -   **Correction:** **Degree Inflation**. Jobs that used to require a HS diploma now require a BA, but the work hasn't changed.

## Related Concepts
-   **[Socialization](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/sociology/socialization.md):** Schools are primary agents.
-   **[Human Capital](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/economics/human-capital.md):** Education as investment in skills.
-   **[Pedagogy](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/education/pedagogy.md):** The method of teaching.

## Applications
-   **Policy:** No Child Left Behind, Common Core.
-   **Economics:** An educated workforce drives growth.

## Criticism and Limitations
-   **Banking Model (Freire):** Treating students as empty accounts to be filled with deposits of knowledge, rather than critical thinkers.
