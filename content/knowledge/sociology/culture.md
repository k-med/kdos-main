## Overview
**Culture** is the "software" of the mind. It is the shared set of beliefs, values, and practices that binds a group together. It tells us what is good, true, and beautiful.

## Core Idea
The core idea is **meaning**. Humans are "animals suspended in webs of significance they themselves have spun" (Geertz). Culture is that web.

## Formal Definition
-   **Material Culture:** Things (Cars, Books, Clothes).
-   **Non-Material Culture:** Ideas (Beliefs, Values, Norms).

## Intuition
-   **Fish in Water:** We are so immersed in our culture we don't notice it until we leave it (Culture Shock).
-   **The Iceberg:** Visible culture (Food, Dress) is just the tip. Deep culture (Concept of time, Logic, Ethics) is hidden.

## Examples
-   **Norms:** Rules of conduct.
    -   *Folkways:* Don't pick your nose (Politeness).
    -   *Mores:* Don't kill people (Morality).
    -   *Taboos:* Don't eat people (Forbidden).
-   **Symbols:** The Cross, The Flag, The Nike Swoosh.
-   **Subculture:** Goths, Gamers, Bikers. Groups with their own distinct culture within the main one.

## Common Misconceptions
-   **Misconception:** Culture = High Art (Opera).
    -   **Correction:** That's "High Culture." Sociologically, culture is *everything* a group does, including memes and fast food.
-   **Misconception:** Some people have "no culture."
    -   **Correction:** Everyone has a culture.

## Applications
-   **Business:** Cross-cultural communication (don't show the soles of your feet in Thailand).
-   **Diplomacy:** Soft Power (Hollywood spreading American culture).

## Criticism and Limitations
-   **Essentialism:** Treating culture as a fixed box ("Chinese culture is X") ignores internal diversity and change.
