## Overview
**Social Structure** is the invisible skeleton of society. It's the framework that limits and guides our behavior. We don't just act randomly; we act within roles, classes, and institutions.

## Core Idea
The core idea is **constraint**. Just as a building's walls determine where you can walk, social structure determines what is "possible" for you.

## Formal Definition
The distinctive, stable arrangement of institutions whereby human beings in a society interact and live together.
-   **Macro Level:** Class systems, Economy.
-   **Micro Level:** Family roles, Friend groups.

## Intuition
-   **The Maze:** You are a rat in a maze. You have "free will" to turn left or right, but the walls (structure) determine the path.
-   **Agency vs. Structure:** The eternal debate. Do we shape society (Agency), or does society shape us (Structure)?

## Examples
-   **Class System:** Being born rich gives you a different structure of opportunities than being born poor.
-   **Gender Roles:** Society expects different behaviors from men and women.
-   **Institutions:** Schools, Banks, Churches. These are the pillars of structure.

## Common Misconceptions
-   **Misconception:** We are completely free individuals.
    -   **Correction:** Sociologists argue we are deeply embedded in social webs. Your "personal" choice to go to college is heavily influenced by structure.
-   **Misconception:** Structure is unchangeable.
    -   **Correction:** It changes, but slowly (e.g., the shift from Feudalism to Capitalism).

## Related Concepts

-   **[Social Stratification](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/sociology/social-stratification.md):** The hierarchy within the structure.
-   **[Functionalism](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/sociology/functionalism.md):** The theory that every part of the structure serves a purpose.

## Applications
-   **Urban Planning:** Designing cities to change social behavior.
-   **Policy:** Trying to fix structural inequality (e.g., Affirmative Action).

## Criticism and Limitations
-   **Determinism:** Focusing too much on structure can make it seem like people are robots with no choice.
