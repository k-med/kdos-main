## Overview
**Socialization** is how we become human. It is the lifelong process of learning the norms, values, and skills needed to participate in society. Without it, we would be feral children.

## Core Idea
The core idea is **internalization**. Society isn't just out there; it gets inside our heads. We learn to police ourselves.

## Formal Definition
The process by which individuals acquire the knowledge, language, social skills, and value to conform to the norms and roles required for integration into a group or community.

## Intuition
-   **The Looking-Glass Self (Cooley):** I am not who I think I am; I am not who you think I am; I am who I think *you* think I am. We build our identity by mirroring others.
-   **Agents of Socialization:**
    1.  **Family:** The primary agent (0-5 years).
    2.  **School:** The hidden curriculum (obedience, schedules).
    3.  **Peers:** Teenage rebellion and conformity.
    4.  **Media:** Shaping our view of the world.

## Examples
-   **Gender Socialization:** We wrap boys in blue and give them trucks; we wrap girls in pink and give them dolls. This shapes their future roles.
-   **Resocialization:** Stripping away an old identity to build a new one (Boot Camp, Prison, Cults).

## Common Misconceptions
-   **Misconception:** It stops when you grow up.
    -   **Correction:** It continues forever. You are socialized into a new job, parenthood, and retirement.
-   **Misconception:** It's brainwashing.
    -   **Correction:** It's inevitable. You can't exist without it. But we do have agency to resist it.

## Related Concepts
-   **[Role](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/sociology/role.md):** The behavior expected of a status.
-   **[Nature vs. Nurture](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/psychology/developmental-psychology.md):** Socialization is the "Nurture" side.
-   **[Deviance](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/sociology/deviance.md):** Failure of socialization.

## Applications
-   **Education:** Schools are factories for socialization.
-   **Parenting:** The conscious effort to socialize kids.

## Criticism and Limitations
-   **Over-socialized conception of man:** Wrongly assuming people are just passive vessels for society's rules. We fight back.
