## Overview
**Race and Ethnicity** are powerful social categories. While they have little biological basis, they have massive social consequences.

## Core Idea
The core idea is **social construction**. Race is not a biological fact (genetically, humans are 99.9% identical). It is a story we tell to justify power and hierarchy.

## Formal Definition
-   **Race:** A category of people who share biologically transmitted traits that members of a society consider important (Skin color).
-   **Ethnicity:** A shared cultural heritage (Language, Religion, Ancestry).

## Intuition
-   **The Thomas Theorem:** "If men define situations as real, they are real in their consequences." Race is biologically fake but socially real.
-   **Prejudice vs. Discrimination:** Prejudice is an attitude (thought). Discrimination is an action (behavior).

## Examples
-   **Institutional Racism:** Racism built into the system (e.g., Redlining in housing, bias in criminal justice). It happens even without individual racists.
-   **White Privilege:** The invisible knapsack of advantages that white people carry (not being followed in a store, seeing people like you in movies).
-   **Assimilation vs. Pluralism:** Melting Pot (everyone becomes the same) vs. Salad Bowl (distinct cultures coexist).

## Common Misconceptions
-   **Misconception:** Racism is just being mean.
    -   **Correction:** It is a system of power. (Prejudice + Power = Racism).
-   **Misconception:** We are "Colorblind."
    -   **Correction:** Ignoring race often means ignoring the problems caused by racism.

## Related Concepts
-   **[Intersectionality](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/sociology/intersectionality.md):** Being Black AND a Woman is different from being just Black or just a Woman.
-   **[Genocide](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/history/genocide.md):** The extreme end of ethnic conflict.
-   **[Segregation](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/sociology/segregation.md):** Physical separation of groups.

## Applications
-   **Diversity Training:** Trying to reduce bias in the workplace.
-   **Affirmative Action:** Policies to correct historical injustices.

## Criticism and Limitations
-   **Identity Politics:** Critics argue focusing too much on group identity divides society.
