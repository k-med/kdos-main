## Overview
Standard deviation is a fundamental descriptive statistic used to quantify the variability or dispersion of a dataset. It summarizes how much individual observations typically differ from the mean.

## Core Idea
The core idea of standard deviation is to measure typical deviation from the average value, rather than just identifying extreme differences. A larger standard deviation indicates that values are more widely spread, while a smaller one indicates tighter clustering around the mean.

## Formal Definition (if applicable)
Standard deviation is defined as the square root of variance. Variance is the average of the squared differences between each data point and the mean. For samples, this average is adjusted to account for estimation from incomplete data; for populations, it is not.

## Intuition
If most values lie close to the mean, the standard deviation is small. If values are frequently far from the mean, the standard deviation grows. Squaring deviations ensures that positive and negative differences do not cancel out and that larger deviations are weighted more heavily.

## Examples
- In exam scores where most students score near the class average, the standard deviation is low.
- In income data with a few extremely high earners, the standard deviation is high due to large deviations from the mean.
- Two datasets can share the same mean but have very different standard deviations, reflecting different levels of consistency.

## Common Misconceptions
- Standard deviation is not the same as range; it reflects typical spread, not just extremes.
- A high standard deviation does not imply poor data quality; it may reflect genuine diversity in the data.
- Standard deviation alone does not describe distribution shape or skewness.

## Related Concepts
- Variance
- Mean
- Z-score
- Normal distribution
- Interquartile range

## Applications
Standard deviation is widely used in data analysis, quality control, finance, scientific measurement, and risk assessment. It underpins standardization methods and probabilistic models that assume normally distributed data.

## Criticism / Limitations
Standard deviation is sensitive to outliers and can be misleading for highly skewed distributions. In such cases, robust measures of spread may be more informative.
