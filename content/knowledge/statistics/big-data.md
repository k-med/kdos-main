## Overview
**Big Data** is the industrial revolution of information. We generate more data every two days than in all of history up to 2003. It changes how we do science, business, and government.

## Core Idea
The core idea is **n=all**. Instead of sampling, we can analyze *everyone*. We don't need to ask why (causation); we just need to know what (correlation).

## Formal Definition
Defined by the **3 Vs**:
1.  **Volume:** Huge amounts of data (Petabytes).
2.  **Velocity:** Streaming in real-time.
3.  **Variety:** Messy data (Text, Video, GPS) not just spreadsheets.

## Intuition
-   **Moneyball:** Using stats to find undervalued baseball players.
-   **Target:** Predicting a teenager was pregnant before her father knew, based on her shopping habits (unscented lotion + vitamins).

## Examples
-   **Google Flu Trends:** Predicting flu outbreaks by search queries. (Failed eventually because the algorithm drifted).
-   **Recommendation Engines:** Netflix knowing what you want to watch.

## Common Misconceptions
-   **Misconception:** More data = Better decisions.
    -   **Correction:** More data can mean more noise. Without a good model, it's just "Big Garbage."
-   **Misconception:** Data is objective.
    -   **Correction:** Data is collected by humans with biases. Algorithms can be racist/sexist if trained on biased data (Algorithmic Bias).

## Applications
-   **Smart Cities:** Optimizing traffic flow.
-   **Genomics:** Personalized medicine based on your DNA.

## Criticism and Limitations
-   **Surveillance Capitalism:** Shoshana Zuboff's critique that our experience is being mined for profit.
