## Overview
**Descriptive Statistics** is about summarizing data. It takes a messy spreadsheet of 10,000 numbers and turns it into a few useful numbers (like an Average) or a picture (Graph).

## Core Idea
The core idea is **simplification**. We trade detail for understanding. We lose the individual data points to see the "shape" of the data.

## Formal Definition
-   **Central Tendency:** Where is the middle? (Mean, Median, Mode).
-   **Dispersion:** How spread out is it? (Range, Variance, Standard Deviation).

## Intuition
-   **Mean (Average):** Add them up and divide. Sensitive to outliers (Bill Gates walks into a bar, everyone becomes a millionaire on average).
-   **Median:** The middle number. Robust to outliers. (Better for income).
-   **Standard Deviation:** The average distance from the mean. High SD = Spread out (Wild). Low SD = Clumped (Consistent).

## Examples
-   **Bell Curve (Normal Distribution):** Most things (Height, IQ) cluster around the mean.
-   **Skew:** When data leans to one side (Income is right-skewed; most are poor, a few are super rich).

## Common Misconceptions
-   **Misconception:** Average is "Normal."
    -   **Correction:** In a bimodal distribution (two humps, like shoe sizes for men and women), the "average" might be a size nobody wears.
-   **Misconception:** Correlation implies Causation.
    -   **Correction:** Just because two lines go up together doesn't mean one causes the other.

## Related Concepts
-   **[Inferential Statistics](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/statistics/inferential-statistics.md):** Using descriptive stats to make guesses about the world.
-   **[Data Visualization](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/computer-science/data-visualization.md):** Making stats pretty.

## Applications
-   **Sports:** Batting averages.
-   **Business:** Quarterly reports.

## Criticism and Limitations
-   **Lying with Statistics:** You can choose the measure (Mean vs. Median) that supports your argument.
