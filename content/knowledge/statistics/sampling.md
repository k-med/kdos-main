## Overview
**Sampling** is the art of tasting the soup. You don't need to drink the whole pot to know if it's salty; you just need a spoonful. But it has to be a *representative* spoonful.

## Core Idea
The core idea is **representativeness**. The sample must look like the population. If you only survey rich people, you can't predict the behavior of the poor.

## Formal Definition
-   **Simple Random Sampling:** Drawing names from a hat. Every member has an equal chance. The gold standard.
-   **Stratified Sampling:** Dividing the population into groups (Strata) and sampling from each (e.g., ensuring you have 50% men and 50% women).

## Intuition
-   **The Soup:** If you don't stir the soup (randomize), you might just get a spoonful of broth and think there are no noodles.
-   **Dewey Defeats Truman:** The famous 1948 newspaper headline that was wrong because the pollsters called people on telephones (who were richer and more Republican).

## Examples
-   **Selection Bias:** Online polls. Only people who care enough to visit the site vote.
-   **Survivorship Bias:** Analyzing only the planes that came back from war (and reinforcing the parts with holes), ignoring the ones that were shot down (and had holes in the engines).

## Common Misconceptions
-   **Misconception:** Bigger sample is always better.
    -   **Correction:** A large biased sample is worse than a small random sample. (2 million biased votes < 1,000 random votes).
-   **Misconception:** You need to sample 10% of the population.
    -   **Correction:** The math of sampling depends on absolute numbers, not percentage. A sample of 1,000 is usually enough for *any* population size (even millions).

## Related Concepts
-   **[Inferential Statistics](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/statistics/inferential-statistics.md):** Relies on sampling.
-   **[Bias](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/psychology/cognitive-bias.md):** Systematic error.

## Applications
-   **Market Research:** Focus groups.
-   **Quality Control:** Testing 1 in 100 cars off the line.

## Criticism and Limitations
-   **Non-Response Bias:** People don't answer their phones anymore. Polling is getting harder.
