## Overview
**Probability** is the logic of uncertainty. It quantifies chance. It tells us that even in a random world, there are patterns we can bet on.

## Core Idea
The core idea is **frequency**. If you flip a coin enough times, it will land on heads 50% of the time. Probability is the ratio of desired outcomes to total possible outcomes.

## Formal Definition
A number between 0 (Impossible) and 1 (Certain).
$P(A) = \frac{\text{Number of ways A can happen}}{\text{Total number of possible outcomes}}$

## Intuition
-   **The Coin Flip:** The simplest model. 50/50.
-   **The Weather:** "30% chance of rain" means in 3 out of 10 days with these conditions, it rained.
-   **Independence:** The coin has no memory. If you get 10 heads in a row, the chance of the next one being heads is still 50%. (Gambler's Fallacy).

## Examples
-   **Bayes' Theorem:** Updating your beliefs based on new evidence. (If a test is 99% accurate, but the disease is rare, a positive result might still be false).
-   **Law of Large Numbers:** The more you play, the closer you get to the expected average. The casino always wins in the long run.

## Common Misconceptions
-   **Misconception:** "One in a million" means it won't happen.
    -   **Correction:** In a country of 300 million, "one in a million" events happen 300 times a day.
-   **Misconception:** Randomness looks random.
    -   **Correction:** True randomness often has clumps (like the iPod shuffle problem). We expect "evenly spaced," which is not random.

## Applications
-   **Finance:** Risk management.
-   **Insurance:** Calculating premiums based on life expectancy.
-   **AI:** Machine learning is just fancy probability.

## Criticism and Limitations
-   **Black Swans:** Probability models often fail to predict extreme, rare events (like the 2008 crash) because they assume a Normal Distribution.
