## Overview
**Time** is one of the most familiar yet mysterious concepts. We measure it, waste it, and run out of it, but defining what it *is* remains a profound philosophical and physical problem.

## Core Idea
The core idea is **change and duration**. Time is the dimension in which change happens.

## Formal Definition
In physics, time is the fourth dimension of spacetime. In metaphysics, there are two main views:
-   **A-Theory (Tensed Time):** Past, Present, and Future are real properties. The passage of time is real.
-   **B-Theory (Tenseless Time):** Time is just a coordinate like space. "Earlier than" and "Later than" are fixed relations. The "flow" of time is an illusion.

## Intuition
-   **A-Theory:** Time is a river flowing past us. The future doesn't exist yet; the past is gone. Only the NOW is real (Presentism).
-   **B-Theory:** Time is a landscape (Block Universe). The dinosaurs are "over there" in time just as New York is "over there" in space. All moments exist equally.

## Examples
-   **Time Dilation:** Einstein showed time slows down at high speeds or in strong gravity. This supports the B-Theory (Block Universe).
-   **Entropy:** The arrow of time (why time moves forward) is linked to the increase of disorder (Second Law of Thermodynamics).

## Common Misconceptions
-   **Misconception:** Time is universal and constant.
    -   **Correction:** Relativity proved time is relative to the observer. There is no "universal clock."
-   **Misconception:** We experience the present instantly.
    -   **Correction:** Because of neural processing lag, we actually live slightly in the past (about 80ms).

## Related Concepts
-   **[Space](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/metaphysics/space.md):** The three-dimensional extent in which objects and events have relative position and direction.
-   **[Eternalism](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/metaphysics/eternalism.md):** The view that past, present, and future all exist.
-   **[Presentism](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/metaphysics/presentism.md):** The view that only the present exists.

## Applications
-   **GPS:** Satellites must correct for relativistic time dilation to be accurate.
-   **History:** The study of events in time.

## Criticism and Limitations
-   **The "Now":** Physics has no explanation for the subjective experience of "Now." It treats all moments as equal coordinates.
