## Overview
**Modality** deals with the *mode* in which things exist or are true. It distinguishes between what *is* (actual), what *could be* (possible), and what *must be* (necessary).

## Core Idea
The core idea is **alternatives**. Reality is just one way things could have been. Modality explores the entire space of possibility.

## Formal Definition
-   **Necessary:** True in all possible worlds (e.g., $2+2=4$).
-   **Possible:** True in at least one possible world (e.g., "I am wearing a red shirt").
-   **Contingent:** True in the actual world, but could have been false.
-   **Impossible:** True in no possible worlds (e.g., "Square circle").

## Intuition
-   **Possible Worlds:** Imagine an infinite library of books. One book describes our universe exactly. Other books describe universes where dinosaurs didn't die, or where gravity is repulsive.
-   **Modal Realism:** David Lewis argued these other worlds are *real* physical places, just disconnected from us.

## Examples
-   **Counterfactuals:** "If I had dropped the glass, it would have broken." This statement relies on modality (what *would* happen in a possible world).
-   **Essentialism:** Are there properties an object *must* have? (e.g., Could Socrates have been an alligator? Probably not. Being human is essential to him).

## Common Misconceptions
-   **Misconception:** "Possible" means "likely."
    -   **Correction:** In philosophy, "possible" just means "not contradictory." A universe made entirely of cheese is possible.
-   **Misconception:** Necessity is just about language.
    -   **Correction:** Kripke argued for *metaphysical necessity* (e.g., Water is H2O) which is true independent of language.

## Related Concepts
-   **[Modal Logic](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/logic/modal-logic.md):** The formal system for reasoning about modality.
-   **[Ontology](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/metaphysics/ontology.md):** Do possible worlds exist?
-   **[Causality](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/metaphysics/causality.md):** Often defined in terms of counterfactuals.

## Applications
-   **Science:** Laws of nature are often seen as "nomologically necessary" (necessary given the laws of physics).
-   **History:** "What if" scenarios (Counterfactual history).

## Criticism and Limitations
-   **Epistemology:** How do we *know* what is possible in other worlds? We can't visit them. We rely on intuition, which is unreliable.
