## Overview
**Ontology** is the study of *being*. It asks the most fundamental question: "What exists?" It categorizes everything in reality into basic types (categories) and explores how they relate to each other.

## Core Idea
The core idea is **categorization of reality**. Just as a biologist classifies animals, an ontologist classifies *everything*. Is a number real? Is a hole real? Is a possibility real?

## Formal Definition
The philosophical study of the nature of being, becoming, existence, or reality, as well as the basic categories of being and their relations.

## Intuition
Imagine making a list of everything in the universe.
-   Tables? Yes.
-   Atoms? Yes.
-   The number 7? Maybe.
-   Harry Potter? No (or maybe yes, as a fictional character?).
Ontology is the set of rules for making that list.

## Examples
-   **Universals vs. Particulars:** Is "Redness" a thing that exists (Universal), or are there just many red things (Particulars)?
-   **Abstract Objects:** Do numbers and logic exist independently of human minds (Platonism)?
-   **Social Ontology:** Do money and nations exist in the same way mountains do? (Institutional facts).

## Common Misconceptions
-   **Misconception:** It's about the meaning of life.
    -   **Correction:** That's existentialism or ethics. Ontology is about the *structure* of reality, not its purpose.
-   **Misconception:** It's useless wordplay.
    -   **Correction:** Computer science uses "ontologies" to structure databases and AI knowledge graphs.

## Related Concepts
-   **[Metaphysics](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/philosophy/metaphysics.md):** The broader field containing ontology.
-   **[Epistemology](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/philosophy/epistemology.md):** The study of knowledge (How do we *know* what exists?).
-   **[Taxonomy](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/biology/taxonomy.md):** Classification in biology (a specific type of ontology).

## Applications
-   **Computer Science:** Semantic Web and Knowledge Representation rely on formal ontologies.
-   **Science:** Theoretical physics often forces us to revise our ontology (e.g., particles are actually excitations of fields).

## Criticism and Limitations
-   **Quine's Criterion:** "To be is to be the value of a variable." Some argue ontology is just about what our best scientific theories say exists, not a separate philosophical inquiry.
