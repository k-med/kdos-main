## Overview
**God** is the central concept of theism and a major subject of metaphysical inquiry. Philosophers don't just ask "Does God exist?" but "What *is* God?" and "Is the concept of God coherent?"

## Core Idea
The core idea is the **Ultimate Reality**. God is usually conceived as the necessary being, the uncaused cause, and the ground of all existence.

## Formal Definition
In classical theism, God is defined by the "Omni" attributes:
-   **Omnipotent:** All-powerful.
-   **Omniscient:** All-knowing.
-   **Omnibenevolent:** All-good.
-   **Omnipresent:** Everywhere.

## Intuition
God is the **answer to the question "Why is there something rather than nothing?"**
-   **Cosmological Argument:** Everything has a cause. The universe must have a First Cause. That cause is God.
-   **Teleological Argument:** The universe looks designed (fine-tuning). There must be a Designer.

## Examples
-   **The Problem of Evil:** If God is all-good and all-powerful, why does evil exist? (The most famous argument against God).
-   **Pascal's Wager:** It is rational to believe in God because the potential gain (heaven) is infinite, while the loss is finite.
-   **Spinoza's God:** God is Nature itself (Pantheism).

## Common Misconceptions
-   **Misconception:** Faith is believing without evidence.
    -   **Correction:** Many theologians argue faith is trust based on reason and revelation.
-   **Misconception:** Science disproves God.
    -   **Correction:** Science studies the natural world; God is usually defined as supernatural or outside space/time. They are often seen as "Non-Overlapping Magisteria" (NOMA).

## Related Concepts
-   **[Theology](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/theology/theology.md):** The study of the nature of God and religious belief.
-   **[Atheism](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/philosophy/atheism.md):** Disbelief or lack of belief in the existence of God.
-   **[Metaphysics](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/philosophy/metaphysics.md):** The branch of philosophy dealing with the first principles of things.

## Applications
-   **Ethics:** Divine Command Theory (Is something good because God commands it, or does God command it because it is good? - Euthyphro Dilemma).
-   **Meaning of Life:** For many, God provides the ultimate purpose.

## Criticism and Limitations
-   **Incoherence:** Can God create a rock so heavy He cannot lift it? (Paradox of Omnipotence).
-   **Hiddenness:** If God exists, why doesn't He make it obvious?
