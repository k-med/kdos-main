## Overview
**Teleology** is the study of purpose, goals, or ends. It asks "What is it *for*?" rather than "How did it happen?" It sees nature as having direction.

## Core Idea
The core idea is **Final Cause**. Aristotle argued that to fully understand a thing, you must know its *telos* (end/goal). The acorn's goal is to become an oak. The eye's goal is to see.

## Formal Definition
An explanation of phenomena by the purpose they serve rather than by postulated causes.

## Intuition
-   **Mechanism:** The heart pumps because electrical signals trigger muscle contractions. (Push from the past).
-   **Teleology:** The heart pumps *in order to* circulate blood. (Pull from the future/goal).

## Examples
-   **Intelligent Design:** The argument that the complexity of life implies a designer (God).
-   **Evolution:** Darwinism eliminated teleology from biology. The eye wasn't *designed* to see; it evolved because seeing provided a survival advantage. (Though we still use teleological language: "The purpose of the heart...").
-   **Human Action:** We are teleological beings. We act for reasons and goals.

## Common Misconceptions
-   **Misconception:** Science rejects all teleology.
    -   **Correction:** It rejects *external* teleology (God's plan) in nature, but accepts *internal* teleology (function) in biology and cybernetics (systems with goals).
-   **Misconception:** It's just religious.
    -   **Correction:** Aristotle's teleology was naturalistic, not religious. He thought purpose was inherent in nature.

## Related Concepts
-   **[Causality](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/metaphysics/causality.md):** Teleology is often contrasted with efficient causality.
-   **[Evolution](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/biology/evolution.md):** The theory that replaced teleological design with natural selection.
-   **[Function](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/biology/function.md):** The modern biological term for "purpose."

## Applications
-   **Biology:** Understanding the function of organs.
-   **Cybernetics:** Designing systems with feedback loops to achieve goals (thermostats, guided missiles).

## Criticism and Limitations
-   **Anthropomorphism:** Projecting human-like intent onto non-human nature (e.g., "The virus *wants* to spread").
-   **Backward Causation:** How can a future goal cause a present event?
