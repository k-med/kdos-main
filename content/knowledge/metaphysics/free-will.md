## Overview
**Free Will** is the capacity of agents to choose between different possible courses of action. It is central to our concepts of moral responsibility, praise, guilt, and the law.

## Core Idea
The core idea is **agency**. Are we the authors of our own actions, or are we just puppets acting out a script written by physics/genetics/environment?

## Formal Definition
The debate centers on the compatibility of free will with **Determinism** (the idea that every event is caused by prior events).
-   **Compatibilism:** Free will and determinism can coexist. (Freedom = acting according to your desires, even if those desires are determined).
-   **Incompatibilism:** Free will and determinism cannot coexist.
    -   *Libertarianism:* We have free will, so determinism is false.
    -   *Hard Determinism:* Determinism is true, so we don't have free will.

## Intuition
-   **Libertarian:** At a fork in the road, I could genuinely go Left or Right. The future is open.
-   **Determinist:** My choice is the result of my brain state, which is the result of my genes + environment. I "choose," but I couldn't have chosen otherwise.

## Examples
-   **Libet Experiment:** Neuroscience study suggesting our brains initiate action *before* we are consciously aware of the decision. Used to argue against free will.
-   **Legal System:** Punishing criminals assumes they *could have done otherwise*.

## Common Misconceptions
-   **Misconception:** Free will means doing whatever you want.
    -   **Correction:** It usually means having the *capacity* to choose, not omnipotence.
-   **Misconception:** Quantum randomness proves free will.
    -   **Correction:** Randomness isn't freedom. A die roll isn't a choice. We want *control*, not randomness.

## Related Concepts
-   **[Determinism](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/metaphysics/determinism.md):** The philosophy that all events, including moral choices, are completely determined by previously existing causes.
-   **[Moral Responsibility](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/ethics/moral-responsibility.md):** The status of morally deserving praise, blame, reward, or punishment.
-   **[Fatalism](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/metaphysics/fatalism.md):** The belief that all events are predetermined and therefore inevitable (different from determinism).

## Applications
-   **Law:** Insanity defense (did they have the capacity to choose?).
-   **Religion:** Theological debate between Predestination (Calvinism) and Free Will (Arminianism).

## Criticism and Limitations
-   **Illusion:** Many scientists and philosophers (Sam Harris, Spinoza) argue free will is a persistent illusion created by our lack of awareness of the causes of our actions.
