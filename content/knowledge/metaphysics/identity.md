## Overview
**Identity** is the concept of "sameness." It asks: What makes an object the *same* object over time, even if it changes? What makes *you* the same person you were as a baby?

## Core Idea
The core idea is **persistence through change**. If I replace every part of a car, is it still the same car? Identity deals with the criteria for numerical sameness.

## Formal Definition
-   **Qualitative Identity:** Two things are exactly alike (e.g., two identical twins).
-   **Numerical Identity:** They are literally the *one and the same* thing (e.g., Clark Kent is Superman).
-   **Leibniz's Law:** If $x$ and $y$ are identical, they share all properties.

## Intuition
-   **Ship of Theseus:** If you replace every plank of a ship one by one, is it the same ship? What if you build a new ship from the old planks? Which one is the "real" ship?
-   **Teleporter Problem:** If a machine scans you, destroys you, and rebuilds an exact copy on Mars, is the copy *you*? Or did you die?

## Examples
-   **Personal Identity:** What defines "you"? Your body? Your memory? Your soul? (Locke argued for memory).
-   **4Dism (Perdurantism):** Objects are 4-dimensional "worms" in spacetime. The "you" right now is just a temporal slice of the whole object.

## Common Misconceptions
-   **Misconception:** Identity is simple.
    -   **Correction:** It gets very messy with vague objects (clouds) or fission cases (splitting an amoeba).
-   **Misconception:** Change is impossible if identity holds.
    -   **Correction:** Identity is *about* how things persist *despite* change.

## Related Concepts
-   **[Ontology](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/metaphysics/ontology.md):** The study of being.
-   **[Time](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/metaphysics/time.md):** Identity over time is the central puzzle.
-   **[Essentialism](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/metaphysics/essentialism.md):** The view that objects have essential properties that define their identity.

## Applications
-   **Law:** Can you punish a criminal for a crime committed 20 years ago? (Assumes personal identity persists).
-   **Computer Science:** Object identity in programming (two variables pointing to the same memory address vs. two equal values).

## Criticism and Limitations
-   **Bundle Theory:** Hume argued there is no underlying "self" or substance, just a bundle of properties and perceptions.
