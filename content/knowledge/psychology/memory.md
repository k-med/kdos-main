## Overview
**Memory** is the glue of identity. Without it, you have no past and no future. It is not a single filing cabinet, but a complex system of multiple processes.

## Core Idea
The core idea is **reconstruction**. We don't play back video tapes. We rebuild memories from fragments every time we access them, making them prone to error.

## Formal Definition
The process of:
1.  **Encoding:** Getting info in.
2.  **Storage:** Keeping it there.
3.  **Retrieval:** Getting it out.

## Intuition
-   **Sensory Memory:** The split-second echo of a sound or image.
-   **Short-Term (Working) Memory:** The "RAM" of your brain. Holds about 7 items for 20 seconds.
-   **Long-Term Memory:** The "Hard Drive." Unlimited capacity.
    -   *Explicit:* Facts (Semantic) and Events (Episodic).
    -   *Implicit:* Skills (Procedural - riding a bike).

## Examples
-   **Flashbulb Memories:** Vivid memories of emotional events (9/11). They feel accurate but are often wrong.
-   **Tip of the Tongue:** Retrieval failure. You have the file, but you can't open it.
-   **Method of Loci:** A memory palace technique used by champions to memorize decks of cards.

## Common Misconceptions
-   **Misconception:** Hypnosis recovers lost memories.
    -   **Correction:** It often implants false ones.
-   **Misconception:** Amnesia means you forget who you are.
    -   **Correction:** That's Hollywood. Real amnesia (like H.M.) usually means you can't form *new* memories.

-   **[Dementia](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/medicine/dementia.md):** The loss of memory.

## Applications
-   **Education:** Studying techniques (Testing Effect > Re-reading).
-   **Eyewitness Testimony:** Highly unreliable, yet used to convict people.

## Criticism and Limitations
-   **The Seven Sins of Memory:** Transience, Absent-mindedness, Blocking, Misattribution, Suggestibility, Bias, Persistence. (Schacter).
