## Overview
**Social Psychology** studies humans in herds. We are social animals, and our behavior changes drastically when we are around others.

## Core Idea
The core idea is the **situation**. We think we act based on our personality, but often we act based on the situation (Fundamental Attribution Error). Good people can do bad things in bad situations.

## Formal Definition
The scientific study of how people's thoughts, feelings, and behaviors are influenced by the actual, imagined, or implied presence of others.

## Intuition
-   **Conformity:** Fitting in. If everyone else stands up, you stand up. (Asch Experiment).
-   **Obedience:** Following orders. (Milgram Experiment: Normal people shocked others just because a guy in a lab coat told them to).
-   **Bystander Effect:** If someone is hurt, you are *less* likely to help if there are many people around (diffusion of responsibility).

## Examples
-   **Stanford Prison Experiment:** Students played guards and prisoners. The "guards" became sadistic within days. (Though the validity of this study is heavily debated now).
-   **Cognitive Dissonance:** The discomfort of holding two conflicting beliefs. We change our beliefs to justify our actions. (e.g., "I smoke, but smoking isn't *that* bad").
-   **Stereotype Threat:** Fear of confirming a negative stereotype can make you perform worse.

## Common Misconceptions
-   **Misconception:** I would never do that (e.g., shock someone).
    -   **Correction:** Yes, you probably would. The power of the situation is stronger than you think.
-   **Misconception:** Brainwashing is magic.
    -   **Correction:** It's just extreme social influence and isolation.

## Related Concepts
-   **[Sociology](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/sociology/sociology.md):** Studies groups/society. Social Psych studies individuals *in* groups.
-   **[Marketing](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/economics/marketing.md):** Using social psych to sell stuff (Social Proof).
-   **[Prejudice](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/sociology/racism.md):** The psychology of "Us vs. Them."

## Applications
-   **Public Policy:** Nudging people to recycle.
-   **Conflict Resolution:** Reducing intergroup tension.

## Criticism and Limitations
-   **Replication Crisis:** Many famous social psych studies (like the Stanford Prison Experiment and Power Posing) have failed to replicate or were flawed. The field is currently fixing itself.
