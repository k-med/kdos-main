## Overview
**Perception** is how we build our world. Sensation is just raw data (light hitting the eye); Perception is the brain making sense of it ("That's a cat").

## Core Idea
The core idea is **construction**. We don't see reality as it is; we see a model our brain builds.
-   **Bottom-Up Processing:** Building from raw data (lines -> shapes -> objects).
-   **Top-Down Processing:** Using expectations to fill in gaps (reading t_is sent_nce).

## Formal Definition
The process of organizing and interpreting sensory information.
-   **Gestalt Principles:** The whole is greater than the sum of its parts. (We see a square, not 4 lines).

## Intuition
-   **The Dress:** Blue/Black or White/Gold? Your brain makes assumptions about the lighting, changing the color you see.
-   **Blind Spot:** You have a hole in your vision where the optic nerve leaves the eye. Your brain fills it in with Photoshop.

## Examples
-   **Visual Illusions:** The Müller-Lyer lines (arrows). Proof that perception is subjective.
-   **Synesthesia:** Crossed wires. Seeing colors when you hear music.
-   **Proprioception:** The sense of where your body is in space. (Close your eyes and touch your nose).

## Common Misconceptions
-   **Misconception:** We have 5 senses.
    -   **Correction:** We have many more (Balance, Temperature, Pain, Proprioception).
-   **Misconception:** Eye = Camera.
    -   **Correction:** A camera records pixels. The eye/brain extracts edges, motion, and meaning.

## Related Concepts
-   **[Consciousness](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/philosophy/consciousness.md):** Perception is the content of consciousness.
-   **[Hallucination](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/psychology/abnormal-psychology.md):** Perception without sensation.
-   **[Virtual Reality](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/computer-science/virtual-reality.md):** Hacking perception.

## Applications
-   **Design:** Using color and shape to guide the eye.
-   **Magic:** Magicians exploit perceptual loopholes (misdirection).

## Criticism and Limitations
-   **Naive Realism:** The belief that we see the world exactly as it is. We don't.
