## Overview
**Clinical Psychology** is the applied side of the field. It deals with diagnosing and treating mental illness. It's what most people think of when they hear "psychologist."

## Core Idea
The core idea is **alleviation of suffering**. Using science to help people live better lives.

## Formal Definition
The integration of science, theory, and clinical knowledge for the purpose of understanding, preventing, and relieving psychologically-based distress or dysfunction.
-   **DSM-5:** The "Bible" of diagnosis (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders).

## Intuition
-   **Diagnosis:** Is it sadness or Major Depressive Disorder? Is it worry or Generalized Anxiety Disorder?
-   **Treatment:** Talk therapy (Psychotherapy) vs. Pills (Psychiatry - though psychologists usually don't prescribe).

## Examples
-   **CBT (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy):** Changing negative thought patterns ("I'm a failure") to change behavior. The gold standard for depression/anxiety.
-   **Schizophrenia:** A severe disorder involving hallucinations and delusions.
-   **PTSD:** Trauma rewiring the brain to be hyper-vigilant.

## Common Misconceptions
-   **Misconception:** Psychologists = Psychiatrists.
    -   **Correction:** Psychiatrists are MDs (doctors) who prescribe meds. Psychologists have PhDs and do therapy/testing.
-   **Misconception:** Mental illness is rare.
    -   **Correction:** 1 in 5 adults experience it each year. It is very common.

## Related Concepts
-   **[Psychiatry](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/medicine/psychiatry.md):** The medical branch of mental health.
-   **[Counseling](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/psychology/counseling.md):** Focuses more on everyday life issues (marriage, career) than severe pathology.
-   **[Abnormal Psychology](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/psychology/abnormal-psychology.md):** The academic study of disorders.

## Applications
-   **Hospitals:** Treating severe cases.
-   **Private Practice:** One-on-one therapy.
-   **Forensics:** Assessing competency to stand trial.

## Criticism and Limitations
-   **Medicalization:** Are we turning normal human emotions (grief, shyness) into "disorders" to sell pills?
-   **Reliability:** Diagnoses can be subjective. Two doctors might give different diagnoses.
