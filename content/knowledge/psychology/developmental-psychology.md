## Overview
**Developmental Psychology** studies how we grow. We aren't born as mini-adults; our minds go through distinct stages of evolution from birth to death.

## Core Idea
The core idea is **stages**. Just as a caterpillar becomes a butterfly, a child's mind fundamentally changes structure.
-   **Piaget:** Cognitive stages (learning to think).
-   **Erikson:** Psychosocial stages (learning to relate).

## Formal Definition
The study of physical, cognitive, and social change throughout the lifespan.

## Intuition
-   **Object Permanence:** Peek-a-boo is fun for babies because they literally think you ceased to exist when you hid your face. They haven't learned that things exist when unseen.
-   **Theory of Mind:** Around age 4, kids realize other people have different thoughts than they do. (The Sally-Anne Test).

## Examples
-   **Attachment Theory (Bowlby):** How you bond with your mom determines how you bond with romantic partners later. (Secure vs. Anxious vs. Avoidant).
-   **Marshmallow Test:** Testing delayed gratification in kids. (Predicts future success... mostly).
-   **Adolescence:** The brain rewires itself, causing risk-taking and emotional volatility.

## Common Misconceptions
-   **Misconception:** Development stops at 18.
    -   **Correction:** We continue to develop through adulthood (Midlife Crisis, Aging). Neuroplasticity persists.
-   **Misconception:** It's all parenting.
    -   **Correction:** Genetics plays a huge role (Nature vs. Nurture).

## Related Concepts
-   **[Education](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/sociology/education.md):** Tailoring teaching to developmental stages.
-   **[Language Acquisition](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/linguistics/language-acquisition.md):** How kids learn to speak.
-   **[Gerontology](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/medicine/gerontology.md):** The study of aging.

## Applications
-   **Parenting:** Understanding what is "normal" behavior.
-   **Law:** Juvenile justice (kids shouldn't be tried as adults because their brains aren't finished).

## Criticism and Limitations
-   **WEIRD Bias:** Most studies are on Western, Educated, Industrialized, Rich, Democratic kids. Development might look different in other cultures.
