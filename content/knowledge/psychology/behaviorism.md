summary: "A systematic approach to understanding the behavior of humans and other animals. It assumes that behavior is either a reflex evoked by the pairing of certain antecedent stimuli in the environment, or a consequence of that individual's history, including especially reinforcement and punishment contingencies."

## Overview
**Behaviorism** was the dominant school of psychology in the mid-20th century. It argued that we can't study the "mind" (it's a black box), so we should only study observable **behavior**.

## Core Idea
The core idea is **conditioning**. All behavior is learned through interaction with the environment.
-   **Classical Conditioning:** Pavlov's Dog. Associating a neutral stimulus (bell) with a biological one (food).
-   **Operant Conditioning:** Skinner Box. Learning through rewards (reinforcement) and punishments.

## Formal Definition
The theory that human and animal behavior can be explained in terms of conditioning, without appeal to thoughts or feelings.

## Intuition
-   **Training a Dog:** You don't explain "sit" to a dog. You push its butt down and give it a treat. Eventually, it learns Sit = Treat. Behaviorists say humans are just complicated dogs.
-   **Gamification:** Apps use variable rewards (likes, loot boxes) to condition you to keep clicking. This is pure Skinner.

## Examples
-   **Little Albert:** Watson conditioned a baby to fear white rats by making a loud noise whenever the rat appeared. (Unethical today).
-   **Skinner's Pigeons:** Pigeons learned to play ping-pong and guide missiles by being rewarded with food.

## Common Misconceptions
-   **Misconception:** It ignores genetics.
    -   **Correction:** Radical Behaviorism (Skinner) downplayed genetics ("Give me a dozen healthy infants... and I'll train them to be anything"), but modern behaviorism accepts biological limits.
-   **Misconception:** It's dead.
    -   **Correction:** Pure behaviorism is dead, but its techniques (CBT, ABA therapy) are widely used.

## Related Concepts
-   **[Cognitive Psychology](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/psychology/cognitive-psychology.md):** The reaction against behaviorism (studying the mind again).
-   **[Free Will](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/metaphysics/free-will.md):** Skinner argued free will is an illusion; we are just responding to our conditioning.
-   **[Habit](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/psychology/habit.md):** Automated behavior.

## Applications
-   **Therapy:** Phobia treatment (Systematic Desensitization).
-   **Parenting:** Time-outs and gold stars.
-   **Marketing:** Brand association.

## Criticism and Limitations
-   **Chomsky's Critique:** Noam Chomsky destroyed behaviorism by showing that language is too complex to be learned just by reinforcement; we must have an innate "Language Acquisition Device."
