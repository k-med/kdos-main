## Overview
**Personality Psychology** asks: Who are you? Why are you shy while your brother is outgoing? It studies the stable traits that make us unique.

## Core Idea
The core idea is **traits**. Personality is built from a set of enduring characteristics that predict behavior across different situations.

## Formal Definition
The dynamic organization within the individual of those psychophysical systems that determine their characteristic behavior and thought.
-   **The Big Five (OCEAN):** The scientifically accepted model.
    1.  **O**penness (Creative vs. Conventional).
    2.  **C**onscientiousness (Organized vs. Careless).
    3.  **E**xtraversion (Outgoing vs. Solitary).
    4.  **A**greeableness (Friendly vs. Critical).
    5.  **N**euroticism (Nervous vs. Confident).

## Intuition
-   **Myers-Briggs (MBTI):** Popular (INTJ, ENFP) but scientifically weak (low reliability). It's "astrology for business people."
-   **Nature vs. Nurture:** Personality is about 50% genetic. You are born with a temperament.

## Examples
-   **Introvert vs. Extrovert:** It's about stimulation. Introverts are easily overstimulated and need quiet to recharge. Extroverts need more stimulation to feel normal.
-   **Psychopathy:** A personality disorder characterized by low empathy and high impulsivity. (The Dark Triad: Narcissism, Machiavellianism, Psychopathy).

## Common Misconceptions
-   **Misconception:** Personality is fixed at birth.
    -   **Correction:** It is stable but can change slowly. People generally become more Conscientious and Agreeable as they age (Maturation Principle).
-   **Misconception:** You are either/or (Introvert OR Extrovert).
    -   **Correction:** It's a bell curve. Most people are Ambiverts (in the middle).

## Related Concepts
-   **[Social Psychology](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/psychology/social-psychology.md):** Focuses on the situation, while Personality focuses on the person.
-   **[Intelligence](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/psychology/intelligence.md):** Often studied alongside personality (Individual Differences).
-   **[Genetics](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/biology/genetics.md):** The biological basis of traits.

## Applications
-   **Hiring:** Companies use personality tests to screen employees (Conscientiousness predicts job performance).
-   **Dating:** Compatibility.

## Criticism and Limitations
-   **Person-Situation Debate:** Mischel argued that the situation predicts behavior better than personality traits. (e.g., An honest person might steal if starving).
