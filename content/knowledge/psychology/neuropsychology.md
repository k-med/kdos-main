## Overview
**Neuropsychology** bridges the gap between the physical brain and the abstract mind. It studies how brain damage affects behavior and cognition.

## Core Idea
The core idea is **localization of function**. Different parts of the brain do different things.
-   **Broca's Area:** Speech production.
-   **Hippocampus:** Memory.
-   **Amygdala:** Fear.

## Formal Definition
The study of the relationship between brain function and behavior. Often involves studying patients with brain lesions (damage).

## Intuition
It's **reverse engineering**. If you break a specific wire in a radio and the volume stops working, you know that wire controls volume. If you have a stroke in the left hemisphere and can't speak, we know language is on the left.

## Examples
-   **Phineas Gage:** A railroad worker who had a metal rod blown through his frontal lobe. He survived but his personality changed from nice to rude/impulsive. Proved the frontal lobe controls personality/inhibition.
-   **H.M.:** A patient who had his hippocampus removed to stop seizures. He lost the ability to form *new* memories (Anterograde Amnesia).
-   **Split Brain:** Patients with a severed corpus callosum have two independent consciousnesses in one head.

## Common Misconceptions
-   **Misconception:** Left Brain = Logic, Right Brain = Creative.
    -   **Correction:** It's a massive oversimplification. Both sides work together for almost everything.
-   **Misconception:** Brain damage is permanent.
    -   **Correction:** **Neuroplasticity** allows the brain to rewire itself and recover function.

## Related Concepts
-   **[Neuroscience](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/biology/neuroscience.md):** The broader biology of the nervous system.
-   **[Neurology](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/medicine/neurology.md):** Medical treatment of brain diseases.
-   **[Cognitive Science](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/psychology/cognitive-science.md):** Modeling the mind.

## Applications
-   **Rehabilitation:** Helping stroke victims relearn skills.
-   **Dementia:** Diagnosing Alzheimer's.

## Criticism and Limitations
-   **Modularity:** The brain is highly interconnected. "Blobology" (pointing to a lit-up spot on an fMRI) doesn't explain *how* it works.
