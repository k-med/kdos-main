## Overview
**Psychoanalysis** is the "talking cure" invented by Sigmund Freud. It focuses on the **unconscious mind**—the dark, hidden part of the iceberg below the surface.

## Core Idea
The core idea is **conflict**. We are torn between our primal desires (Id) and societal rules (Superego). This conflict creates anxiety, which we hide with Defense Mechanisms.

## Formal Definition
A theory of personality and a method of psychotherapy.
-   **Id:** "I want it now!" (Instincts, Sex, Aggression).
-   **Ego:** "Let's work this out." (Reality principle).
-   **Superego:** "That's not nice." (Morality, Conscience).

## Intuition
-   **Freudian Slip:** You say "sex" instead of "six." Freud says this isn't an accident; it reveals your unconscious desire.
-   **Dreams:** The "royal road to the unconscious." Your brain acting out forbidden wishes in code.

## Examples
-   **Oedipus Complex:** A child's unconscious desire for the opposite-sex parent and rivalry with the same-sex parent. (Controversial).
-   **Defense Mechanisms:**
    -   *Repression:* Pushing bad memories down.
    -   *Projection:* "I'm not angry, you're angry!"
    -   *Sublimation:* Channeling aggression into sports or art.

## Common Misconceptions
-   **Misconception:** It's all about sex.
    -   **Correction:** Freud was obsessed with libido, but later analysts (Jung, Adler) focused on other drives (power, meaning).
-   **Misconception:** It's scientific.
    -   **Correction:** Popper called it "Pseudoscience" because it's unfalsifiable. (If you deny your Oedipus complex, that's just "resistance," proving you have one!).
