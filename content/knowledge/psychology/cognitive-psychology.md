## Overview
**Cognitive Psychology** is the study of how people think. It treats the brain like a computer: input (senses) -> processing (cognition) -> output (behavior).

## Core Idea
The core idea is **information processing**. We don't just react to stimuli (like behaviorists thought); we interpret, store, and manipulate information.

## Formal Definition
The study of internal mental processes. It investigates how people perceive, learn, remember, and think.

## Intuition
-   **Attention:** The spotlight of the mind. You can't process everything, so you filter. (Cocktail Party Effect).
-   **Memory:** Not a video recording, but a reconstruction. (Short-term vs. Long-term memory).
-   **Heuristics:** Mental shortcuts we use to make decisions quickly (but sometimes irrationally).

## Examples
-   **Stroop Effect:** It's hard to say the color of the word "RED" if it's printed in blue ink. Shows interference in processing.
-   **False Memories:** You can be convinced you remember things that never happened (Loftus).
-   **Change Blindness:** You fail to notice big changes in a scene if your attention is elsewhere.

## Common Misconceptions
-   **Misconception:** We use 10% of our brains.
    -   **Correction:** We use all of it. Just not all at once for every task.
-   **Misconception:** Memory is perfect.
    -   **Correction:** Every time you recall a memory, you rewrite it. It is highly fallible.

## Related Concepts
-   **[Neuroscience](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/biology/neuroscience.md):** The hardware (brain) running the software (cognition).
-   **[Artificial Intelligence](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/computer-science/artificial-intelligence.md):** Modeling cognition in machines.
-   **[Behavioral Economics](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/economics/behavioral-economics.md):** Applying cognitive biases to money.

## Applications
-   **Education:** Designing better teaching methods (Spaced Repetition).
-   **UX Design:** Making apps intuitive to use.
-   **Therapy:** CBT (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy) fixes "bugs" in your thinking patterns.

## Criticism and Limitations
-   **Ecological Validity:** Lab experiments (memorizing word lists) might not reflect how we think in the real world.
