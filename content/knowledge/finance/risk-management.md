## Overview
Making money is easy; keeping it is hard. Risk management is the art of not blowing up. It involves identifying, measuring, and mitigating risks.

## Core Idea
**Value at Risk (VaR):** A statistical measure. "We are 99% confident that we won't lose more than \$10 million in a single day." (But that 1% can kill you).

## Formal Definition (if applicable)
**Stress Testing:** Simulating extreme scenarios (e.g., "What if the stock market drops 50% and interest rates double?") to see if the bank survives.

## Intuition
- **Market Risk:** Prices move against you.
- **Credit Risk:** Borrowers don't pay you back.
- **Operational Risk:** Computers crash, fraud, or a pandemic hits.
- **Liquidity Risk:** You can't sell your assets when you need cash.

## Examples
- **Hedging:** Buying insurance against a crash (Put options).
- **Diversification:** Spreading bets.
- **Collateral:** Asking for a house as security for a mortgage.

## Common Misconceptions
- "Risk management eliminates risk." (No, it manages it. You need to take risk to make profit.)
- "Models are perfect." (The map is not the territory. "Black Swans" break models.)

## Related Concepts
- **Basel Accords:** International rules on how much capital banks must hold.
- **Moral Hazard:** If you are insured (or bailed out), you take more risks.
- **Tail Risk:** The risk of extreme events (the tails of the bell curve).

## Applications
- **Banks:** Required by law to have robust risk management.
- **Insurance:** Their entire business is pricing risk.

## Criticism / Limitations
VaR can give a false sense of security. It failed spectacularly in 2008.
