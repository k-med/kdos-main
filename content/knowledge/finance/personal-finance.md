## Overview
It's not about how much you make; it's about how much you keep. Personal finance is the application of financial principles to your own life.

## Core Idea
**Live below your means.** Spend less than you earn and invest the difference. It's simple math, but hard psychology.

## Formal Definition (if applicable)
**The 50/30/20 Rule:**
- 50% Needs (Rent, Food).
- 30% Wants (Fun, Travel).
- 20% Savings/Debt Repayment.

## Intuition
- **Emergency Fund:** 3-6 months of expenses in cash. (For when the car breaks or you lose your job).
- **Compound Interest:** Start early. \$1 saved at 20 is worth \$10 at 60.
- **Debt:** High-interest debt (Credit Cards) is a fire. Put it out immediately.

## Examples
- **401(k) / IRA:** Tax-advantaged retirement accounts.
- **Index Funds:** Low-cost, diversified investing (Vanguard).
- **Fiduciary:** A financial advisor who is legally required to act in your best interest.

## Common Misconceptions
- "I don't make enough to save." (Even \$10 a month helps build the habit.)
- "Investing is for rich people." (You can start with \$1.)
- "Buying a house is always better than renting." (Not always. Renting offers flexibility and no maintenance costs.)

## Related Concepts
- **FIRE (Financial Independence, Retire Early):** Saving 50%+ of income to retire in your 30s or 40s.
- **Credit Score:** Your financial report card.
- **Inflation:** Why you need to invest, not just save (cash loses value).

## Applications
- **Budgeting Apps:** Mint, YNAB.
- **Life Planning:** Buying a home, paying for college.

## Criticism / Limitations
"Latte factor" advice (skip coffee to get rich) ignores structural economic problems like stagnant wages and high housing costs.
