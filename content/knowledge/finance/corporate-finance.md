## Overview
How does a company decide whether to build a new factory? How should it pay for it (Debt vs. Equity)? Should it pay dividends or buy back stock?

## Core Idea
**Maximizing Shareholder Value:** The primary goal of financial management is to maximize the current value per share of the existing stock.

## Formal Definition (if applicable)
**Modigliani-Miller Theorem:** In a perfect market (no taxes, no bankruptcy costs), the value of a firm is independent of its capital structure (how much debt vs. equity it has). It's like slicing a pizza—the size of the pizza doesn't change depending on how you slice it.

## Intuition
- **Debt (Bonds):** Cheaper (tax deductible), but risky (you must pay interest or go bankrupt).
- **Equity (Stocks):** Safer (no mandatory payments), but expensive (dilutes ownership).

## Examples
- **IPO (Initial Public Offering):** Going from private to public to raise cash.
- **M&A (Mergers and Acquisitions):** Buying another company to grow.
- **WACC (Weighted Average Cost of Capital):** The hurdle rate a project must beat to be profitable.

## Common Misconceptions
- "Profit is Cash." (You can be profitable on paper but go bankrupt if you run out of cash. Cash is King.)
- "Dividends are free money." (When a dividend is paid, the stock price drops by that amount.)

## Related Concepts
- **Agency Problem:** Managers might act in their own interest (private jets) rather than shareholders' interest.
- **Leverage:** Using debt to amplify returns (and risks).
- **Financial Statements:** Balance Sheet, Income Statement, Cash Flow Statement.

## Applications
- **CFO:** Chief Financial Officer makes these decisions.
- **Investment Banking:** Helping companies raise money.

## Criticism / Limitations
Focusing only on shareholder value can harm employees, customers, and the environment (Stakeholder Theory).
