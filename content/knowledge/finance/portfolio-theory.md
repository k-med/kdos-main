## Overview
"Don't put all your eggs in one basket." MPT proves this mathematically. By combining assets that don't move together (uncorrelated), you can reduce risk without reducing return.

## Core Idea
**Diversification:** The only "free lunch" in finance. If you own one stock, you have high risk. If you own 500 stocks (S&P 500), the individual ups and downs cancel out, leaving only the market risk.

## Formal Definition (if applicable)
**Efficient Frontier:** The set of optimal portfolios that offer the highest expected return for a defined level of risk. You want to be on the frontier.

## Intuition
- **Stock A:** Does well in summer (Ice cream).
- **Stock B:** Does well in winter (Umbrellas).
- **Portfolio A+B:** Does okay all year round. Less volatility, steady return.

## Examples
- **60/40 Portfolio:** 60% Stocks (Growth), 40% Bonds (Safety).
- **Index Funds:** Buying the whole market to get maximum diversification.
- **Rebalancing:** Selling winners and buying losers to maintain your target allocation.

## Common Misconceptions
- "Diversification eliminates all risk." (It eliminates *idiosyncratic* risk—company specific—but not *systematic* risk—market crashes.)
- "More stocks is always better." (After about 30 stocks, the benefit of diversification diminishes.)

## Related Concepts
- **Correlation:** A measure of how two assets move together (-1 to +1). You want low or negative correlation.
- **Variance:** A measure of volatility (risk).
- **Risk Tolerance:** How much pain can you handle?

## Applications
- **Retirement Planning:** Asset allocation is the most important decision.
- **Endowments:** Managing university funds.

## Criticism / Limitations
Correlations tend to go to 1 during a crisis (everything crashes together). MPT assumes normal distributions (bell curves), but markets have "fat tails" (black swans).
