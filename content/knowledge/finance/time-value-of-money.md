## Overview
A dollar today is worth more than a dollar tomorrow. Why? Because you can invest the dollar today and earn interest. This simple idea is the foundation of all finance.

## Core Idea
**Compounding:** Interest on interest. Einstein called it the "eighth wonder of the world."
$$ FV = PV \times (1 + r)^n $$
- $FV$: Future Value
- $PV$: Present Value
- $r$: Interest Rate
- $n$: Number of periods

## Formal Definition (if applicable)
**Discounting:** The process of determining the present value of a payment or a stream of payments that is to be received in the future. It's the reverse of compounding.

## Intuition
Would you rather have \$100 now or \$100 in 10 years? Obviously now.
Would you rather have \$100 now or \$200 in 10 years? That depends on the interest rate. If you can earn 10% a year, \$100 becomes \$259 in 10 years. So take the \$100 now.

## Examples
- **Mortgage:** You borrow \$300k but pay back \$600k over 30 years because of interest.
- **Retirement:** Saving a little bit early is better than saving a lot late.
- **Lottery:** Lump sum (PV) vs. Annuity (payments over time).

## Common Misconceptions
- "Interest is linear." (No, it's exponential. Small differences in rates make huge differences over time.)
- "Inflation doesn't matter." (Real return = Nominal return - Inflation).

## Related Concepts
- **NPV (Net Present Value):** The value of an investment minus its cost. If NPV > 0, do it.
- **IRR (Internal Rate of Return):** The break-even interest rate.
- **Opportunity Cost:** The money you could have earned elsewhere.

## Applications
- **Valuation:** How much is a company worth? (The sum of its future cash flows, discounted back to today).
- **Personal Finance:** Should I pay off debt or invest?

## Criticism / Limitations
Assumes a constant interest rate, which rarely happens in the real world.
