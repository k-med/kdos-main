## Overview
Wall Street. The City of London. Tokyo. Financial markets are where capital meets ideas. They allow companies to raise money and investors to grow their wealth.

## Core Idea
**Liquidity:** The ease with which an asset can be converted into cash without affecting its price. Cash is perfectly liquid. Real estate is illiquid. Markets provide liquidity.

## Formal Definition (if applicable)
**Market Microstructure:** The study of the process and outcomes of exchanging assets under explicit trading rules. (How the plumbing works: Order books, bid-ask spreads, high-frequency trading).

## Intuition
It's a giant auction.
- **Stock Market:** Buying ownership in companies (NYSE, Nasdaq).
- **Bond Market:** Lending money to governments and companies (Bigger than the stock market).
- **Forex (Foreign Exchange):** Trading currencies (The biggest market of all).

## Examples
- **Primary Market:** Where new securities are issued (IPO).
- **Secondary Market:** Where existing securities are traded (Stock Exchange).
- **OTC (Over-the-Counter):** Direct trading between two parties without an exchange.

## Common Misconceptions
- "The stock market is the economy." (No, the market looks forward; the economy looks at now. They can diverge.)
- "Buy low, sell high." (Easier said than done.)

## Related Concepts
- **Bull Market:** Prices rising.
- **Bear Market:** Prices falling (20% drop).
- **Volatility:** How much prices swing.

## Applications
- **Capital Allocation:** Directing money to the most productive uses.
- **Price Discovery:** Determining the fair value of assets.

## Criticism / Limitations
Markets can be irrational (Bubbles and Crashes). They can also be rigged (Insider Trading).
