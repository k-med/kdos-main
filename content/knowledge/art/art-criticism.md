## Overview
**Art Criticism** is the conversation about art. It's asking: "What does this mean?" and "Is it any good?"

## Core Idea
The core idea is **Interpretation**. Art is a language, and the critic is the translator.

## Formal Definition
The description, analysis, interpretation, and judgment of works of art.
-   **Formalism:** Judging art by its form (color, line) only.
-   **Contextualism:** Judging art by its context (history, politics).

## Intuition
-   **The Guide:** A good critic is like a tour guide. They point out things you might have missed.
-   **The Filter:** Critics help filter the massive amount of art produced.

## Examples
-   **Clement Greenberg:** Championed Abstract Expressionism (Pollock).
-   **John Ruskin:** Championed the Pre-Raphaelites.

## Common Misconceptions
-   **Misconception:** It's just opinion.
    -   **Correction:** It is *informed* opinion, backed by history and theory.
-   **Misconception:** Critics just hate everything.
    -   **Correction:** Critics love art; that's why they hold it to a high standard.
