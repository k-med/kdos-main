  The Golden Ratio (represented by the Greek letter phi, φ) is a special number approximately equal to 1.618. It appears many times in geometry, art, architecture and other areas. It is believed to be the most aesthetically pleasing proportion to the human eye.

## Overview
Is there a formula for beauty? The Greeks thought so. They discovered a ratio that seemed to appear everywhere in nature—in the spiral of a nautilus shell, the arrangement of leaves on a stem, the proportions of the human body. They called it the Divine Proportion. Artists have used it for centuries to create compositions that feel "right."

## Core Idea
The core idea is **Harmony**. The Golden Ratio creates a sense of balance that is neither too symmetrical (boring) nor too chaotic (messy). It divides a space in a way that guides the eye naturally.

## Formal Definition
Two quantities are in the golden ratio if their ratio is the same as the ratio of their sum to the larger of the two quantities.
Algebraically: (a+b)/a = a/b = φ ≈ 1.6180339887...

## Intuition
Draw a rectangle. If the long side is 1.618 times longer than the short side, it is a "Golden Rectangle." If you cut a square off this rectangle, the leftover piece is *another* Golden Rectangle. You can keep doing this forever, creating a spiral. This spiral is the shape of a galaxy or a hurricane.

## Examples
-   **The Parthenon:** The facade of this Greek temple fits almost perfectly into a Golden Rectangle. (Though some argue this was accidental).
-   **Leonardo da Vinci, *The Vitruvian Man*:** The famous drawing of a man in a circle and square. Leonardo used the Golden Ratio to map the ideal proportions of the human body (e.g., the distance from your belly button to the floor vs. your total height).
-   **Salvador Dalí, *The Sacrament of the Last Supper*:** A modern example. Dalí explicitly used a Golden Rectangle canvas and arranged the figures according to the ratio to create a mystical, divine atmosphere.

## Common Misconceptions
-   **It's magic:** It's just a number. It doesn't guarantee good art. You can use the ratio and still make a bad painting.
-   **It's everywhere:** People tend to see it where it isn't (confirmation bias). Not every spiral is a Golden Spiral.

## Related Concepts
-   **Fibonacci Sequence:** A series of numbers (0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13...) where each number is the sum of the two before it. The ratio between these numbers gets closer and closer to the Golden Ratio (φ) as you go higher.
-   **Rule of Thirds:** A simplified version used in photography. You divide the image into 9 squares. It's not exactly the Golden Ratio, but it serves the same purpose of off-center balance.

## Applications
-   **Graphic Design:** Logos (like Apple or Twitter) often use circles based on the Golden Ratio to look balanced.
-   **Web Design:** Layouts often use the ratio to determine the width of the main content vs. the sidebar (e.g., 640px vs 400px).

## Criticism / Limitations
-   **Over-hyped:** Many claims about the Golden Ratio (e.g., that the Egyptians used it for the Pyramids) are historically dubious.
-   **Cultural Bias:** It is a Western ideal of beauty. Other cultures (like Japan) have different ratios (like the Silver Ratio) that they find more beautiful.
