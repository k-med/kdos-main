## Overview
**Color Theory** is the science of how colors interact. It explains why some combinations look great (harmony) and others make your eyes bleed (discord).

## Core Idea
The core idea is **Relationship**. Colors change based on what they are next to. Red looks different next to green than it does next to orange.

## Formal Definition
The study of color mixing and the visual effects of color combinations.
-   **Hue:** The color itself (Red, Blue).
-   **Saturation:** The intensity (Bright vs. Dull).
-   **Value:** The lightness (Light vs. Dark).

## Intuition
-   **The Color Wheel:** A map of relationships.
    -   *Complementary:* Opposites (Red/Green). High contrast.
    -   *Analogous:* Neighbors (Blue/Green/Teal). Harmonious.
    -   *Triadic:* Triangle (Red/Yellow/Blue). Balanced.
-   **Temperature:** Warm colors (Red, Orange) advance. Cool colors (Blue, Green) recede.

## Examples
-   **Impressionists:** Used complementary colors in shadows to make light pop (e.g., purple shadows for yellow sunlight).
-   **Branding:** McDonald's uses Red and Yellow (Hunger, Speed). Banks use Blue (Trust, Stability).

## Common Misconceptions
-   **Misconception:** Black makes things darker.
    -   **Correction:** Adding black "muddies" the color. Artists often use the complementary color to darken (e.g., add green to red to make a rich shadow).
-   **Misconception:** RGB and CMYK are the same.
    -   **Correction:** RGB is *Additive* (Light/Screens). CMYK is *Subtractive* (Pigment/Print).

-   **[Perception](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/psychology/perception.md):** How the eye sees color.

## Applications
-   **Graphic Design:** Creating logos and layouts.
-   **Interior Design:** Mood setting.

## Criticism and Limitations
-   **Subjectivity:** Color meanings vary by culture (White is purity in the West, mourning in the East).
