## Overview
Art fights a losing battle against time. Light fades colors. Humidity rots canvas. Insects eat wood. The Art Conservator is the doctor who fights these diseases. They use chemistry, X-rays, and microscopes to diagnose the problem and delicate surgery to fix it. But unlike a doctor, their patient is 500 years old and worth $100 million.

## Core Idea
The core idea is **Reversibility**. This is the Golden Rule of conservation. Whatever you do to a painting (gluing a tear, painting over a scratch), you must be able to *undo* it later. Why? Because future technology might find a better way, or we might realize we made a mistake. Never do permanent damage.

## Formal Definition
The ethical stewardship of cultural heritage.
-   **Preservation:** Preventing damage (e.g., controlling the temperature in the museum).
-   **Restoration:** Fixing damage that has already happened (e.g., cleaning off yellow varnish).

## Intuition
Imagine a dirty window. You can't see the view. A conservator cleans the window (removes the old varnish). Suddenly, the colors pop. The blue sky is blue again. But if you scrub too hard, you scratch the glass (damage the original paint). It is a high-stakes balance between cleaning and destroying.

## Examples
-   **The Sistine Chapel Restoration (1980s):** They cleaned off centuries of candle soot. The result was shocking. Michelangelo wasn't a dark, moody painter; he used bright neon pinks and greens! Some critics hated it, saying they "ruined" the mystery.
-   **Ecce Homo (The "Monkey Jesus"):** A well-meaning amateur tried to restore a fresco of Jesus in Spain and turned him into a blurry monkey. It became a meme, but it highlights the danger of untrained restoration.
-   **The Vasa:** A Swedish warship that sank in 1628. When they raised it in 1961, they had to spray it with polyethylene glycol (PEG) for 17 years to replace the water in the wood cells, or it would have crumbled to dust.

## Common Misconceptions
-   **They just repaint it:** No! They only paint in the *losses* (the holes). They never paint *over* the original artist's work. This is called "inpainting."
-   **It makes it look new:** The goal is not to make it look new; the goal is to make it look *true*. We accept some signs of age (crackle) as part of the object's history.

## Related Concepts
-   **Provenance:** The history of who owned the art. Conservators help establish this by analyzing the materials (e.g., "This pigment wasn't invented until 1800, so this can't be a Da Vinci").
-   **Preventive Conservation:** The boring but important stuff: controlling light (Lux), relative humidity (RH), and pests (IPM).
-   **Pentimento:** "Repentance." When a conservator uses X-rays to see a change the artist made (e.g., moving a hand). It shows the artist's thought process.

## Applications
-   **Forensics:** Identifying fakes. If a painting claims to be from 1600 but contains Titanium White (invented in 1921), it's a fake.
-   **Digital Conservation:** How do we preserve "Net Art" or video games? Hard drives fail. Code becomes obsolete. This is the new frontier.

## Criticism / Limitations
-   **Subjectivity:** Who decides what the painting is *supposed* to look like? By cleaning it, are we imposing our modern taste for bright colors on the past?
-   **The Ship of Theseus:** If you replace 50% of a rotting sculpture, is it still the same sculpture?
