## Overview
Take some mud. Shape it. Put it in a fire. It turns into stone. This magical transformation (pyrotechnology) was one of the first technologies humans invented (25,000 years ago). Ceramics are the most common artifact found by archaeologists because they never rot. They are the plastic of the ancient world.

## Core Idea
The core idea is **Transformation**. Clay is soft, plastic, and malleable. You can imprint your fingerprint on it. But once it is fired (sintered), it becomes hard, brittle, and permanent. It captures a fleeting gesture forever.

## Formal Definition
Objects made from clay and other raw materials hardened by heat.
-   **Earthenware:** Low fire, porous (flower pots).
-   **Stoneware:** High fire, waterproof (dinner plates).
-   **Porcelain:** Very high fire, white, translucent (fine china).

## Intuition
Hold a ceramic mug. It is made of earth. It was shaped by a hand (or a machine mimicking a hand). It was glazed with glass. It is a perfect marriage of the four elements: Earth (clay), Water (to shape it), Air (to dry it), and Fire (to harden it).

## Examples
-   **Greek Vases:** The "Black Figure" and "Red Figure" pottery. They weren't just pots; they were the comic books of the ancient world, telling myths and stories of daily life.
-   **Ming Dynasty Vases:** The peak of porcelain technology. The blue pigment (cobalt) came from Persia, showing early global trade. They were so valuable in Europe that kings collected them.
-   **Ai Weiwei, *Sunflower Seeds* (2010):** He filled the Tate Modern with 100 million porcelain sunflower seeds. Each one was hand-painted by a worker in China. It was a commentary on mass production and the "made in China" phenomenon.

## Common Misconceptions
-   **It's just "craft":** For a long time, art critics looked down on ceramics as "functional" (not "fine art"). But artists like Peter Voulkos in the 1950s started tearing pots apart and making abstract sculptures, proving clay could be expressive.
-   **It's fragile:** Drop a plate, it breaks. But bury a shard in the ground, and it lasts for 10,000 years. It is both fragile and eternal.

## Related Concepts
-   **Glaze:** A layer of glass fused to the ceramic surface. It makes it waterproof and colorful. It is complex chemistry (silica + flux + metal oxides).
-   **Kiln:** The oven used to fire the clay. It can reach 2400°F (1300°C).
-   **Wabi-Sabi:** The Japanese aesthetic that values imperfection. A tea bowl that is slightly crooked or cracked (Kintsugi—repaired with gold) is considered more beautiful than a perfect one.

## Applications
-   **Space Shuttle:** The heat shield tiles on the Space Shuttle were high-tech ceramics.
-   **Medicine:** Ceramic hip replacements.

## Criticism / Limitations
-   **Unpredictability:** The "Kiln Gods." You can spend weeks making a sculpture, put it in the kiln, and it explodes or the glaze turns an ugly color. You have to surrender control to the fire.
