## Overview
**Art History** is the story of humanity told through images. It tracks how we see the world and how we represent it, from cave paintings to NFTs.

## Core Idea
The core idea is **Context**. Art doesn't happen in a vacuum. It reflects the politics, religion, and technology of its time.

## Formal Definition
The academic study of the history and development of painting, sculpture, and the other visual arts.

## Intuition
-   **The Mirror:** Art mirrors society. The rigid, hierarchical art of Egypt reflects a rigid, hierarchical society. The chaotic, fragmented art of the 20th century reflects a chaotic, fragmented world.
-   **The Pendulum:** Styles often swing back and forth. The emotional Baroque reacts against the rational Renaissance. The messy Romanticism reacts against the clean Neoclassicism.

## Examples
-   **Renaissance:** Rebirth of classical learning. Focus on realism, perspective, and humanism (Michelangelo, Da Vinci).
-   **Impressionism:** Capturing the fleeting moment of light. A reaction against the studio perfection of the Academy (Monet, Renoir).
-   **Modernism:** Breaking the rules. Abstraction, Surrealism, Cubism (Picasso, Dali).

## Common Misconceptions
-   **Misconception:** It's just memorizing dates and names.
    -   **Correction:** It's about visual literacy—learning to "read" an image and understand its power.
-   **Misconception:** Modern art is "easy."
    -   **Correction:** "My kid could paint that." Maybe, but your kid didn't have the *idea* to paint that in 1915 when everyone else was painting horses.

## Related Concepts
-   **[Aesthetics](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/philosophy/aesthetics.md):** The philosophy of beauty.
-   **[History](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/history/historiography.md):** The broader context.

## Applications
-   **Museum Curation:** Preserving and displaying culture.
-   **Design:** Understanding past styles to create new ones.

## Criticism and Limitations
-   **Eurocentrism:** Traditional art history often ignores non-Western art.
