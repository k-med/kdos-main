## Overview
**Architecture** is where art meets engineering. It is the design of the spaces we live in. It shapes our behavior and our mood.

## Core Idea
The core idea is **Function**. A painting just has to look good. A building has to stand up and keep the rain out. "Form follows function" (Sullivan).

## Formal Definition
The process and the product of planning, designing, and constructing buildings or other structures.

## Intuition
-   **The Shelter:** The most basic need.
-   **The Symbol:** Buildings are symbols of power (Pyramids, Skyscrapers, Cathedrals).
-   **The Machine for Living:** Le Corbusier's definition of a house. Efficient, clean, functional.

## Examples
-   **Gothic:** Verticality, light, stained glass (Notre Dame). Reaching for God.
-   **Modernism:** Glass, steel, concrete. Rejection of ornament (Bauhaus).
-   **Brutalism:** Raw concrete. Honest, heavy, monumental.

## Common Misconceptions
-   **Misconception:** Architects just draw pretty pictures.
    -   **Correction:** They have to know physics, materials, law, and sociology.
-   **Misconception:** Old buildings are always better.
    -   **Correction:** Survivorship bias. We only kept the good old ones. The bad ones fell down.

-   **[Urban Planning](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/sociology/urban-sociology.md):** Designing cities.

## Applications
-   **Sustainability:** Green buildings.
-   **Psychology:** Designing hospitals that help people heal.

## Criticism and Limitations
-   **Hostile Architecture:** Designing benches so homeless people can't sleep on them.
