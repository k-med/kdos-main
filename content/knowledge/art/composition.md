## Overview
**Composition** is how you arrange the furniture in the room of your image. It guides the viewer's eye and tells them what is important.

## Core Idea
The core idea is **Control**. You are directing the viewer's gaze. You want them to look *here*, then *there*, then stay.

## Formal Definition
The placement or arrangement of visual elements in a work of art.

## Intuition
-   **Rule of Thirds:** Divide the image into a tic-tac-toe grid. Place interesting things on the intersections. It creates dynamic balance.
-   **Leading Lines:** Lines that point to the subject (e.g., a road, a fence, a gaze).
-   **Hierarchy:** Make the most important thing the biggest, brightest, or sharpest.

## Examples
-   **The Last Supper (Da Vinci):** All lines point to Jesus' head (Linear Perspective as composition).
-   **Film:** Directors use composition to show power dynamics (low angle = powerful, high angle = weak).

## Common Misconceptions
-   **Misconception:** Center the subject.
    -   **Correction:** Centering is static and boring (unless you want symmetry). Off-center is dynamic.
-   **Misconception:** Fill every space.
    -   **Correction:** **Negative Space** (empty space) is just as important as the subject. It gives the eye a place to rest.

## Applications
-   **Photography:** Framing the shot.
-   **UI/UX Design:** Guiding the user to the "Buy" button.

## Criticism and Limitations
-   **Rule Breaking:** Sometimes a chaotic, unbalanced composition is exactly what you need (to show anxiety or war).
