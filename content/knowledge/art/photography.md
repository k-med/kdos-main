## Overview
**Photography** (Greek *photos* "light" + *graphé* "drawing") is drawing with light. It democratized art. Before the camera, only the rich could have a portrait. Now, everyone has a camera in their pocket.

## Core Idea
The core idea is **Capture**. Freezing a moment in time.

## Formal Definition
The process of recording images on a light-sensitive medium (film or sensor).
-   **Exposure Triangle:**
    -   *Aperture:* How wide the hole is (Depth of Field).
    -   *Shutter Speed:* How long the hole is open (Motion Blur).
    -   *ISO:* How sensitive the sensor is (Noise).

## Intuition
-   **The Eye:** The camera is a mechanical eye. Lens = Cornea/Lens. Aperture = Iris. Sensor = Retina.
-   **The Frame:** Photography is about what you *exclude*. You choose what to put in the box.

## Examples
-   **Ansel Adams:** Landscape photography. Mastering the technical to capture the sublime.
-   **Henri Cartier-Bresson:** The "Decisive Moment." Street photography.
-   **Dorothea Lange:** Documentary photography. "Migrant Mother."

## Common Misconceptions
-   **Misconception:** A better camera takes better pictures.
    -   **Correction:** A good chef can cook a great meal on a cheap stove. It's about the eye, not the gear.
-   **Misconception:** Photos don't lie.
    -   **Correction:** Photos are always an interpretation. Cropping, angle, and editing can completely change the meaning.

## Applications
-   **Journalism:** Bearing witness.
-   **Science:** Astrophotography, microscopy.

## Criticism and Limitations
-   **Manipulation:** Photoshop and Deepfakes.
