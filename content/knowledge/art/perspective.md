## Overview
**Perspective** is the illusion of depth. It's the math trick that makes a flat canvas look like a window into a 3D world.

## Core Idea
The core idea is **Convergence**. Parallel lines appear to meet in the distance.

## Formal Definition
-   **Linear Perspective:** Using vanishing points and horizon lines to create depth.
-   **Atmospheric Perspective:** Things further away look bluer and hazier.

## Intuition
-   **Railroad Tracks:** You know the tracks are parallel, but they look like they touch at the horizon. That point is the **Vanishing Point**.
-   **The Box:**
    -   *1-Point Perspective:* Looking straight at the front of the box.
    -   *2-Point Perspective:* Looking at the corner of the box.
    -   *3-Point Perspective:* Looking down from a skyscraper (vertical lines converge too).

## Examples
-   **Brunelleschi:** The architect who "discovered" linear perspective in the Renaissance.
-   **Escher:** Played with perspective to create impossible objects (stairs that go up forever).

## Common Misconceptions
-   **Misconception:** It's how we really see.
    -   **Correction:** We have two eyes (binocular vision) and curved retinas. Linear perspective is a mathematical *approximation* of vision (like a camera).
-   **Misconception:** Ancient art was "bad" at perspective.
    -   **Correction:** They often used **Hierarchical Perspective** (Kings are big, servants are small) because they cared about *status*, not realism.

## Applications
-   **3D Modeling:** Video games use perspective projection matrices.
-   **Architecture:** Rendering buildings.

## Criticism and Limitations
-   **Distortion:** Wide-angle perspective distorts shapes at the edges.
