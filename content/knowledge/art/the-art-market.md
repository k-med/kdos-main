## Overview
**The Art Market** is where culture meets capitalism. It's a strange, unregulated market where a canvas can sell for $450 million.

## Core Idea
The core idea is **Subjective Value**. A painting has no intrinsic value (it's just canvas and oil). Its value comes from consensus, scarcity, and status.

## Formal Definition
The global marketplace of buyers and sellers of art.
-   **Primary Market:** Buying directly from the artist (Galleries).
-   **Secondary Market:** Reselling art (Auctions like Sotheby's).

## Intuition
-   **The Veblen Good:** Art is a luxury good. The higher the price, the more people want it (status symbol).
-   **The Lottery:** For every artist who makes millions, 10,000 make nothing.

## Examples
-   **Salvator Mundi:** Sold for $450 million. Was it really by Da Vinci? Does it matter?
-   **Banksy:** Shredded his own artwork at auction. It doubled in value.

## Common Misconceptions
-   **Misconception:** Price = Quality.
    -   **Correction:** Price = Hype + Scarcity + Provenance (who owned it before).
-   **Misconception:** It's a good investment.
    -   **Correction:** It's high risk, illiquid, and has high transaction costs.

## Related Concepts
-   **[Economics](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/economics/supply-and-demand.md):** Supply is fixed (dead artists don't paint), demand fluctuates.
-   **[Money Laundering](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/criminology/white-collar-crime.md):** The art market is often used for this because it's opaque.

## Applications
-   **Investment:** Art funds.
-   **Tax Evasion:** Freeports.

## Criticism and Limitations
-   **Commodification:** Turning culture into an asset class ruins the art.
