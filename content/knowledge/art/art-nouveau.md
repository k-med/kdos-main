  Art Nouveau ("New Art") was an international style of art, architecture, and applied art, especially the decorative arts, known in different languages by different names: Jugendstil in German, Stile Liberty in Italian, Modernismo in Spanish. It was inspired by natural forms and structures, particularly the curved lines of plants and flowers.

## Overview
In the 1890s, artists were bored with copying the past (Neo-Gothic, Neo-Classical). They wanted a style for the *modern* age. But instead of looking to machines (like the Futurists would later), they looked to **Nature**. Not the realistic nature of the Romantics, but the abstract, flowing lines of vines, flower stems, and insect wings. They wanted to turn the whole world into a garden.

## Core Idea
The core idea is **The Whiplash Line**. A dynamic, undulating curve that looks like a snapping whip or a growing vine. It represents vitality and growth. Art Nouveau rejected the straight line (which they saw as dead and mechanical) in favor of the organic curve.

## Formal Definition
An ornamental style of art that flourished between about 1890 and 1910 throughout Europe and the United States. It is characterized by its use of a long, sinuous, organic line and was employed most often in architecture, interior design, jewelry and glass design, posters, and illustration.

## Intuition
Look at a Paris Metro station entrance (designed by Hector Guimard). The green metal looks like melting stalks of alien plants. It doesn't look "built"; it looks "grown." That is Art Nouveau. It tries to make iron and glass feel alive.

## Examples
-   **Gustav Klimt, *The Kiss* (1908):** The masterpiece of the Vienna Secession (the Austrian version). A couple wrapped in gold robes decorated with geometric and organic patterns. It is erotic, decorative, and flat.
-   **Antoni Gaudí:** The architect of Barcelona. His *Sagrada Família* church looks like a dripping sandcastle or a forest of stone trees. There are no straight lines in nature, so there are no straight lines in his buildings.
-   **Tiffany Lamps:** Louis Comfort Tiffany used stained glass to create lamps that looked like wisteria vines or dragonflies.

## Common Misconceptions
-   **It's just pretty decoration:** It was a social movement. They wanted to break down the hierarchy between "High Art" (painting) and "Craft" (furniture). A spoon should be as artistic as a statue.
-   **It's Art Deco:** People confuse them. Art Nouveau (1890-1910) is curvy and organic (plants). Art Deco (1920-1940) is geometric and streamlined (machines).

## Related Concepts
-   **Japonisme:** The influence of Japanese woodblock prints (flat colors, asymmetry, nature themes) was huge on Art Nouveau.
-   **Femme Fatale:** The style often featured mysterious, seductive women with long, flowing hair that blended into the decorative background (e.g., Alphonse Mucha's posters).
-   **Gesamtkunstwerk:** Like the Baroque and Bauhaus, they aimed for a total environment where the wallpaper matched the furniture matched the dress.

## Applications
-   **Graphic Design:** The psychedelic posters of the 1960s (Fillmore West) revived the Art Nouveau style because its trippy, flowing lines fit the drug culture perfectly.
-   **Jewelry:** René Lalique made jewelry using glass and enamel that looked like insects and dying flowers, valuing the design over the cost of the diamonds.

## Criticism / Limitations
-   **Cost:** It was supposed to be "art for everyone," but the hand-crafted, complex curves were incredibly expensive to make. It became a luxury style for the rich.
-   **Over-decoration:** It died out quickly because people got sick of the visual clutter. The clean lines of Modernism (Bauhaus) wiped it out.
