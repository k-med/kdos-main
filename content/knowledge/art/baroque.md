## Overview
If the Renaissance was about calm, balance, and reason (circles and squares), the Baroque (approx. 1600-1750) was about emotion, movement, and awe (ovals and spirals). It began in Rome as a tool of the Catholic Church. To fight the Protestant Reformation, the Church wanted art that would grab the viewer by the soul and overwhelm them with the glory of God.

## Core Idea
The core idea is **theatricality**. Baroque art is a stage production. It uses dramatic lighting, intense facial expressions, and swirling compositions to make the viewer feel like they are witnessing a miracle *right now*. It breaks the "fourth wall" and invades the viewer's space.

## Formal Definition
A style characterized by dynamic movement, overt emotion, and self-confident rhetoric. Key techniques include **Chiaroscuro** (strong contrast between light and dark) and **Tenebrism** (extreme spotlight effects).

## Intuition
-   **Renaissance Statue (Michelangelo's David):** David stands still, thinking *before* the fight. He is calm.
-   **Baroque Statue (Bernini's David):** David is biting his lip, twisting his body, in the *middle* of throwing the stone. He is pure action. You feel like you have to duck.

## Examples
-   **Caravaggio:** The bad boy of the Baroque. He painted saints with dirty feet and used dramatic, single-source lighting (*The Calling of St Matthew*). He made the sacred look gritty and real.
-   **Bernini's *Ecstasy of Saint Teresa*:** A sculpture of a saint being pierced by an angel's arrow. It is incredibly sensual, depicting spiritual ecstasy as physical pleasure. The marble looks like flowing fabric and soft flesh.
-   **Versailles:** The palace of Louis XIV. It is Baroque architecture at its peak—massive scale, gold everywhere, mirrors, and gardens designed to show man's dominance over nature.

## Common Misconceptions
-   **It means "fancy":** Today we use "baroque" to mean overly decorated. But originally, the decoration had a purpose: to direct the eye and create an emotional effect.
-   **It was only Catholic:** There was also a "Dutch Golden Age" Baroque (Rembrandt, Vermeer) which was Protestant. It was quieter, focused on domestic scenes and portraits, but used the same dramatic light.

## Related Concepts
-   **Counter-Reformation:** The political/religious movement that fueled the Baroque. The Church needed art to be a weapon of persuasion.
-   **Gesamtkunstwerk:** "Total work of art." Baroque churches combined painting, sculpture, and architecture into one unified immersive experience.
-   **Vanitas:** A genre of still life (skulls, rotting fruit) reminding viewers of death, popular in the Baroque.

## Applications
-   **Film:** The dramatic lighting of Film Noir is a direct descendant of Caravaggio's chiaroscuro.
-   **Politics:** The "Baroque" style of power—overwhelming the citizen with spectacle—is still used by dictators and corporations.

## Criticism / Limitations
-   **Kitsch:** Because it is so emotional and manipulative, Baroque art can easily slide into bad taste or melodrama.
-   **Propaganda:** It was essentially high-budget propaganda for the Church and Absolute Monarchs.
