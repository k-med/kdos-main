## Overview
Why paint a bowl of apples? It seems boring. But for centuries, Still Life (*Nature Morte* or "Dead Nature") was the laboratory of art. Because the apples don't move and don't complain (unlike a portrait sitter), the artist can focus entirely on composition, light, and technique. It is the purest form of painting.

## Core Idea
The core idea is **The Transience of Life**. A flower blooms, then wilts. A fruit ripens, then rots. By painting these things, the artist is meditating on time and death. They are freezing a moment that is destined to vanish.

## Formal Definition
A work of art depicting mostly inanimate subject matter. It is the lowest rung on the traditional "Hierarchy of Genres" (below History, Portrait, and Landscape), but often the most intellectually complex.

## Intuition
Look at a Dutch still life from the 1600s. It looks like a feast. But look closer. The lemon is peeled (bitter). The flower has a bug on it (decay). The skull is hiding in the back. It is not just a picture of food; it is a sermon: "Eat, drink, and be merry, for tomorrow you die."

## Examples
-   **Caravaggio, *Basket of Fruit* (1599):** One of the first independent still lifes. The apple has a wormhole. The leaves are drying up. It is hyper-realistic and sad.
-   **Paul Cézanne:** He painted the same apples and oranges over and over again. He wasn't interested in the fruit; he was interested in the *geometry*. He used the fruit to break reality down into spheres and cones, paving the way for Cubism.
-   **Van Gogh, *Sunflowers*:** They are not pretty flowers. They are exploding with yellow energy. They are portraits of the sun itself.

## Common Misconceptions
-   **It's easy:** It is actually very hard to make a static object look interesting. You have to create drama with just light and arrangement.
-   **It's just decoration:** It is often deeply symbolic. A broken glass might mean a lost virginity. A violin might mean the fleeting nature of music (and life).

## Related Concepts
-   **Vanitas:** A specific type of still life explicitly about death. Symbols include skulls, hourglasses, and extinguished candles.
-   **Trompe-l'œil:** "Trick the eye." A still life so realistic that you try to grab the object.
-   **Objecthood:** In modern art, the "Readymade" (Duchamp's urinal) is the ultimate still life—the object itself, without the painting.

## Applications
-   **Advertising:** Every product shot in a magazine is a still life. The lighting techniques invented by Dutch painters are used today to sell burgers and watches.
-   **Mindfulness:** Painting (or looking at) a still life is a form of meditation. It forces you to slow down and really *see* the world.

## Criticism / Limitations
-   **Materialism:** It celebrates ownership. The Dutch Golden Age still lifes were basically "wealth flexes" for rich merchants to show off their imported goods (porcelain, exotic fruits).
