## Overview
**Digital Art** is art made with code and pixels. It ranges from painting on an iPad to generative algorithms that create infinite variations.

## Core Idea
The core idea is **Virtualization**. The canvas is infinite. The "Undo" button exists.

## Formal Definition
Art that uses digital technology as an essential part of the creative or presentation process.
-   **Raster:** Pixels (Photoshop). Like painting.
-   **Vector:** Math (Illustrator). Like drawing with infinite precision.

## Intuition
-   **The Tool:** The computer is just a fancy brush.
-   **The Layer:** Separating elements so you can change the background without ruining the foreground.

## Examples
-   **CGI (Computer Generated Imagery):** Movies like *Avatar*.
-   **Pixel Art:** Nostalgic aesthetic from early video games.
-   **Generative Art:** Writing code that draws (Processing, p5.js).

## Common Misconceptions
-   **Misconception:** The computer does the work.
    -   **Correction:** You still need to know anatomy, color, and composition. The computer just renders it.
-   **Misconception:** It's not "real" art because there is no original.
    -   **Correction:** NFTs attempt to solve this by creating artificial scarcity.

## Related Concepts
-   **[Computer Science](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/computer-science/algorithms.md):** The underlying technology.
-   **[AI Art](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/computer-science/artificial-intelligence.md):** The new frontier (Midjourney).

## Applications
-   **Game Design:** Creating worlds.
-   **VFX:** Movie magic.

## Criticism and Limitations
-   **Obsolescence:** Digital files can become unreadable (Bit Rot).
