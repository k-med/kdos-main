## Overview
**Sculpture** is art you can bump into. It occupies real space. It engages with gravity, light, and texture in a way painting cannot.

## Core Idea
The core idea is **Form**. It's about mass and volume.

## Formal Definition
Three-dimensional art created by shaping or combining hard or plastic material, sound, or text and or light, commonly stone (either rock or marble), clay, metal, glass, or wood.

## Intuition
-   **Subtractive vs. Additive:**
    -   *Subtractive (Carving):* Starting with a block of stone and taking away everything that isn't the statue. (Michelangelo).
    -   *Additive (Modeling):* Starting with nothing and adding clay or wax. (Rodin).
-   **The Tactile:** You want to touch it. It appeals to our sense of touch even if we can't touch it.

## Examples
-   **David (Michelangelo):** The pinnacle of marble carving.
-   **The Thinker (Rodin):** Bronze casting.
-   **Readymades (Duchamp):** Taking a urinal and calling it art. Redefining sculpture as "selection."

## Common Misconceptions
-   **Misconception:** It has to be a statue of a person.
    -   **Correction:** Modern sculpture can be abstract, kinetic (moving), or an installation (a whole room).
-   **Misconception:** Bronze statues are carved.
    -   **Correction:** They are cast. You make a mold, pour in molten metal.

## Related Concepts
-   **[3D Modeling](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/art/digital-art.md):** Digital sculpture.
-   **[Architecture](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/art/architecture.md):** Sculpture you can live in.

## Applications
-   **Monuments:** Public memory.
-   **Industrial Design:** Designing cars and phones (sculpting with function).

## Criticism and Limitations
-   **Permanence:** Stone lasts forever, but it's hard to move.
