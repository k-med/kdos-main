## Overview
A war without (direct) fighting. Two superpowers with enough nukes to destroy the world 10 times over, staring each other down for 45 years.

## Core Idea
**MAD (Mutually Assured Destruction):** If you attack me, I will destroy you, even if I am already dead. This terrifying logic actually kept the peace (The Long Peace).

## Formal Definition (if applicable)
**Containment:** The US strategy to stop the spread of Communism. "Domino Theory"—if one country falls (Vietnam), the neighbors will fall too.

## Intuition
It was a contest of systems. Who can build the best rockets? Who can win the most Olympic medals? Who offers the better life?

## Examples
- **Proxy Wars:** Fighting in Korea, Vietnam, and Afghanistan. The superpowers funded the sides but didn't fight each other directly.
- **Cuban Missile Crisis (1962):** The closest we came to nuclear apocalypse.
- **Space Race:** Sputnik (USSR) vs. Moon Landing (USA).

## Common Misconceptions
- "It was just US vs USSR." (The "Third World" or Non-Aligned Movement tried to stay out of it.)
- "Reagan won it." (The Soviet economy collapsed from within due to inefficiency and the cost of the arms race.)

## Related Concepts
- **McCarthyism:** The Red Scare. Witch hunts for communists in the US.
- **Perestroika & Glasnost:** Gorbachev's reforms (Restructuring & Openness) that accidentally led to the end of the USSR.
- **The End of History:** Fukuyama's idea that with the fall of the Berlin Wall (1989), liberal democracy had won forever. (He was wrong).

## Applications
- **Internet:** Started as ARPANET, a military network designed to survive a nuclear strike.
- **GPS:** Military tech.

## Criticism / Limitations
It justified supporting brutal dictators as long as they were anti-communist.
