## Overview
Before smartphones, before castles, before Rome, there were the first cities. Humans stopped wandering and started building.

## Core Idea
**The Neolithic Revolution:** The invention of agriculture allowed humans to settle in one place. This surplus of food allowed for specialization (priests, soldiers, kings) and the birth of civilization.

## Formal Definition (if applicable)
**Cradle of Civilization:** The locations where civilization independently emerged: Mesopotamia (Tigris-Euphrates), Egypt (Nile), Indus Valley (Indus), China (Yellow River), Mesoamerica, and Andean Coast.

## Intuition
Why rivers? Rivers provide water for farming, mud for bricks, and a highway for trade. But they also flood, requiring organized labor to build levees (hence, government).

## Examples
- **Sumerians:** Invented writing (Cuneiform) and the wheel.
- **Egyptians:** Pyramids, mummies, and a 3,000-year stable empire.
- **Harappans (Indus Valley):** Planned cities with sewage systems (lost until the 1920s).

## Common Misconceptions
- "They were primitive." (They built monuments we still can't replicate easily and had complex laws like the Code of Hammurabi.)
- "Aliens built the pyramids." (No, humans with ropes, ramps, and a lot of time did.)

## Related Concepts
- **Bronze Age:** The era defined by the use of bronze (Copper + Tin).
- **Polytheism:** Belief in many gods (usually associated with nature).
- **City-State:** A city that is also an independent country (e.g., Uruk, Athens).

## Applications
- **Archaeology:** Digging up the past.
- **Linguistics:** Deciphering Rosetta Stones.

## Criticism / Limitations
History is written by the victors (and the literate). We know a lot about kings, but little about the 99% of people who were farmers or slaves.
