## Overview
The "Great War." The "War to End All Wars." It destroyed four empires (German, Austro-Hungarian, Ottoman, Russian) and redrew the map of the world. It was the suicide of Europe.

## Core Idea
**Industrialized Slaughter:** 19th-century tactics (charging) met 20th-century technology (machine guns, poison gas, artillery). The result was a stalemate.

## Formal Definition (if applicable)
**Total War:** A war where the entire society is mobilized. Factories make shells, women work in factories, food is rationed. Civilians are targets.

## Intuition
- **The Spark:** Assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand in Sarajevo.
- **The Powder Keg:** A web of secret alliances. (Austria attacks Serbia -> Russia attacks Austria -> Germany attacks Russia -> France attacks Germany -> UK attacks Germany).

## Examples
- **Trench Warfare:** Living in mud, rats, and lice. "Going over the top" meant almost certain death.
- **The Somme:** 60,000 British casualties on the *first day*.
- **Russian Revolution:** The war caused the collapse of the Tsar and the rise of Communism (Lenin).

## Common Misconceptions
- "Germany started it." (It's complicated. Everyone was eager for war. Germany gets the blame because they lost.)
- "It solved nothing." (True. The peace treaty (Versailles) was so harsh on Germany that it practically guaranteed WWII.)

## Related Concepts
- **Shell Shock:** PTSD.
- **League of Nations:** The first attempt at a UN (failed).
- **Spanish Flu:** A pandemic that killed more people than the war itself.

## Applications
- **Middle East:** The borders drawn after the Ottoman collapse (Sykes-Picot) are still causing conflicts today.

## Criticism / Limitations
"Lions led by donkeys." (The brave soldiers were led by incompetent generals).
