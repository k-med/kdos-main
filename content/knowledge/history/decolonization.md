## Overview
In 1945, 1/3 of the world lived in colonies ruled by Europe. By 1975, almost all of them were independent nations. It was the birth of the modern world map.

## Core Idea
**Self-Determination:** The right of a people to choose their own government. After fighting Hitler for freedom, the Allies couldn't justify keeping colonies.

## Formal Definition (if applicable)
**Neocolonialism:** Even after political independence, former colonies often remained economically dependent on their former masters.

## Intuition
- **Peaceful:** India (Gandhi's non-violent resistance).
- **Violent:** Algeria, Vietnam, Kenya. (Wars of liberation).

## Examples
- **Partition of India (1947):** The British left in a hurry, splitting the country into India (Hindu) and Pakistan (Muslim). Millions died in the chaos.
- **Scramble for Africa:** Reversed. Dozens of new countries were born in the 1960s ("The Year of Africa").
- **Apartheid:** The white minority rule in South Africa lasted until 1994.

## Common Misconceptions
- "The Europeans gave them freedom." (Usually, it was taken or demanded.)
- "Independence solved everything." (Colonial borders often ignored ethnic lines, leading to civil wars later, e.g., Rwanda, Nigeria).

## Related Concepts
- **Third World:** Originally meant "Not West (1st) and Not East (2nd)." Now implies poverty.
- **Pan-Africanism:** The idea that African nations should unite.

## Applications
- **Development Economics:** Why are some nations poor? (Legacy of extraction).
- **Migration:** People from former colonies moving to the "Mother Country" (Indians to UK, Algerians to France).

## Criticism / Limitations
"Flag Independence." You have a flag and an anthem, but the IMF runs your economy.
