## Overview
The sequel that was worse than the original. The deadliest conflict in human history (70-85 million dead). It was a clear fight between Good (Democracy/Communism) and Evil (Fascism).

## Core Idea
**Ideological War:** It wasn't just about land; it was about how the world should be run. Fascism (Hitler/Mussolini) vs. Liberal Democracy (Churchill/Roosevelt) vs. Communism (Stalin).

## Formal Definition (if applicable)
**Genocide:** The deliberate killing of a large number of people from a particular nation or ethnic group. (The Holocaust: 6 million Jews murdered).

## Intuition
- **Blitzkrieg:** "Lightning War." Using tanks and planes to move fast and encircle the enemy. (Opposite of WWI trenches).
- **Strategic Bombing:** Destroying the enemy's cities and factories from the air.

## Examples
- **Pearl Harbor:** Brought the US into the war.
- **Stalingrad:** The turning point in Europe. The Soviets stopped the Nazis.
- **Hiroshima & Nagasaki:** The first (and only) use of nuclear weapons. Ended the war in the Pacific.

## Common Misconceptions
- "The US won the war." (The US provided the money and machines, but the Soviet Union provided the blood. 80% of German casualties were on the Eastern Front.)
- "The French surrendered immediately." (They fought hard but were outmaneuvered by Blitzkrieg.)

## Related Concepts
- **United Nations:** Created to prevent WWIII.
- **The Iron Curtain:** The division of Europe between West and East after the war.
- **Nuremberg Trials:** Holding leaders personally responsible for "Crimes Against Humanity."

## Applications
- **Geopolitics:** The US and USSR emerged as Superpowers.
- **Technology:** Radar, Jet Engines, Computers, Nuclear Power.

## Criticism / Limitations
The Allies committed war crimes too (Firebombing of Dresden/Tokyo), though not on the scale of the Axis.
