## Overview
The "Age of Reason." If the Renaissance was about Art, the Enlightenment was about Science and Politics. It gave us democracy, human rights, and the scientific method.

## Core Idea
**Sapere Aude:** "Dare to know." (Kant). Have the courage to use your own understanding instead of relying on authority (Church or King).

## Formal Definition (if applicable)
**Social Contract:** The idea that government gets its power from the consent of the governed, not from God. If the government fails to protect rights, the people can overthrow it (Locke).

## Intuition
Before: "The King is God's representative. Obey."
After: "We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal."

## Examples
- **Voltaire:** Champion of free speech and religious tolerance. "I disapprove of what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it."
- **Adam Smith:** *The Wealth of Nations*. Free markets and the "Invisible Hand."
- **The Encyclopedia (Diderot):** Attempting to collect all human knowledge in one place.

## Common Misconceptions
- "They were atheists." (Most were Deists—they believed in a Creator who set the universe in motion like a clockmaker but doesn't interfere.)
- "Reason solves everything." (The French Revolution showed that reason can lead to the Guillotine if not tempered by tradition/morality.)

## Related Concepts
- **Liberalism:** Individual liberty, private property, limited government.
- **Separation of Powers:** Montesquieu (Executive, Legislative, Judicial).
- **Empiricism:** Knowledge comes from observation (Newton).

## Applications
- **Constitutions:** The US Constitution is a direct product of Enlightenment thought.
- **Modern Science:** The belief that the universe follows rational laws.

## Criticism / Limitations
It was often blind to race and gender. Many Enlightenment thinkers owned slaves or thought women were inferior.
