## Overview
The Industrial Revolution amplified muscle. The Information Revolution amplified mind. We are swimming in data.

## Core Idea
**Moore's Law:** The number of transistors on a chip doubles every two years. This exponential growth made computers cheap, fast, and ubiquitous.

## Formal Definition (if applicable)
**The Network Effect:** A network becomes more valuable the more people use it (Metcalfe's Law). One fax machine is useless. Two are okay. A billion is a revolution.

## Intuition
- **Bit vs. Atom:** Atoms are heavy and hard to move. Bits are weightless and move at the speed of light.
- **Zero Marginal Cost:** It costs millions to make the first copy of Windows. It costs \$0 to make the second.

## Examples
- **The Internet (1990s):** The World Wide Web (Tim Berners-Lee).
- **Smartphone (2007):** The iPhone put the internet in everyone's pocket.
- **Social Media:** Facebook, Twitter. Everyone is a publisher.

## Common Misconceptions
- "Information is Knowledge." (We have more info, but maybe less wisdom. "Infobesity").
- "The Digital Divide is gone." (Billions still lack access).

## Related Concepts
- **Globalization:** The world is flat (Friedman). Supply chains span the globe.
- **Gig Economy:** Uber, Airbnb.
- **Surveillance Capitalism:** "If the product is free, you are the product."

## Applications
- **Remote Work:** Zoom.
- **E-commerce:** Amazon killing malls.
- **Crypto:** Digital money.

## Criticism / Limitations
Mental health issues, polarization, loss of privacy, and the attention economy.
