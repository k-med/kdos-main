## Overview
Often called the "Dark Ages," but that's unfair. It was a time of castles, cathedrals, and the formation of modern Europe. Meanwhile, the Islamic world was having a Golden Age of science and math.

## Core Idea
**Feudalism:** A social system based on land and loyalty.
- **King:** Owns all land.
- **Lords:** Get land from King, provide soldiers.
- **Knights:** Fight for Lords.
- **Peasants (Serfs):** Work the land in exchange for protection.

## Formal Definition (if applicable)
**Christendom:** The unifying concept of Europe as a religious community under the Pope, even while divided politically.

## Intuition
Life was local. You were born, lived, and died in the same village. The Church was the only universal institution.

## Examples
- **The Crusades:** Holy wars between Christians and Muslims for control of Jerusalem.
- **The Black Death (1347):** A plague that killed 1/3 of Europe. Paradoxically, it helped the survivors by making labor scarce and valuable (ending serfdom).
- **Magna Carta (1215):** The first time a King (John) was forced to admit he wasn't above the law.

## Common Misconceptions
- "Everyone believed the earth was flat." (Educated people knew it was round since the Greeks.)
- "It was all dirty and ignorant." (They built Gothic cathedrals and founded the first universities like Oxford and Bologna.)

## Related Concepts
- **Chivalry:** The code of conduct for knights.
- **Monasticism:** Monks preserving knowledge in libraries.
- **The Silk Road:** Trade route connecting Europe and Asia (Marco Polo).

## Applications
- **Fantasy Literature:** Tolkien and Game of Thrones are based on this era.
- **Legal Systems:** Common Law started here.

## Criticism / Limitations
The term "Middle Ages" is Eurocentric. In China, it was the Tang/Song Dynasties (high civilization). In the Americas, the Maya and Aztecs were rising.
