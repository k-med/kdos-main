## Overview
"Rebirth." Europe woke up. They rediscovered Greek and Roman art, invented the printing press, and started sailing around the world.

## Core Idea
**Humanism:** A shift in focus from God and the afterlife to Human potential and the here-and-now. "Man is the measure of all things."

## Formal Definition (if applicable)
**Perspective:** An artistic technique to create the illusion of 3D depth on a 2D surface. (Medieval art looked flat; Renaissance art looked like a window).

## Intuition
Imagine finding a cache of advanced technology from a lost civilization. That's what rediscovering Plato and Cicero felt like to Italians in the 1400s.

## Examples
- **Leonardo da Vinci:** The ultimate "Renaissance Man" (Painter, Engineer, Scientist).
- **Gutenberg:** The Printing Press (1440) made books cheap. Information could no longer be controlled by the Church.
- **Machiavelli:** *The Prince*. Realpolitik. "It is better to be feared than loved."

## Common Misconceptions
- "It happened overnight." (It was a slow process starting in Italy and spreading North.)
- "Everyone was enlightened." (Witch hunts and religious wars actually increased during this time.)

## Related Concepts
- **The Reformation:** Martin Luther challenging the Pope (made possible by the printing press).
- **The Age of Exploration:** Columbus, Da Gama, Magellan.
- **Scientific Revolution:** Copernicus saying the Earth goes around the Sun.

## Applications
- **Art:** The Mona Lisa, The David, The Sistine Chapel.
- **Education:** The liberal arts curriculum.

## Criticism / Limitations
It was an elite movement. For the average peasant, life didn't change much.
