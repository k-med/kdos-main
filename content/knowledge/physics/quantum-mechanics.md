## Overview
**Quantum Mechanics (QM)** is the physics of the very small. It reveals a world that is fundamentally weird, probabilistic, and counter-intuitive. It shattered the deterministic clockwork universe of Newton.

## Core Idea
The core idea is **wave-particle duality**. Matter (electrons) acts like waves, and light (photons) acts like particles. Nothing has a definite position until you measure it.

## Formal Definition
The state of a system is described by a **Wave Function** ($\Psi$). The **Schrödinger Equation** describes how this wave evolves.
-   **Born Rule:** The square of the wave function ($|\Psi|^2$) gives the *probability* of finding the particle at a certain spot.

## Intuition
-   **Superposition:** Schrödinger's Cat is both dead and alive until you open the box. An electron is in many places at once.
-   **Entanglement:** "Spooky action at a distance." Two particles can be linked so that measuring one instantly affects the other, even light-years away.
-   **Uncertainty Principle:** You can't know both position and momentum perfectly. The more you know one, the less you know the other (Heisenberg).

## Examples
-   **Double Slit Experiment:** Electrons fired at two slits create an interference pattern (like waves), even if fired one by one. But if you *watch* which slit they go through, they act like particles.
-   **Tunneling:** A particle can pass through a solid wall if it borrows energy for a short enough time.

## Common Misconceptions
-   **Misconception:** Quantum means "magic" or "consciousness."
    -   **Correction:** It is a precise mathematical theory. "Observation" usually means interaction with a particle, not a conscious human looking.
-   **Misconception:** It only applies to atoms.
    -   **Correction:** It applies to everything, but the effects wash out at large scales (decoherence).

## Related Concepts
-   **[Quantum Computing](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/computer-science/quantum-computing.md):** Using superposition (qubits) to solve problems faster than classical computers.
-   **[Standard Model](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/physics/standard-model.md):** The catalog of subatomic particles.
-   **[Many-Worlds Interpretation](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/physics/many-worlds-interpretation.md):** The idea that every quantum choice splits the universe.

## Applications
-   **Electronics:** Transistors and lasers rely entirely on quantum effects.
-   **MRI:** Uses nuclear magnetic resonance (quantum spin).

## Criticism and Limitations
-   **Incompatibility:** QM and General Relativity (Gravity) don't get along. We still lack a "Theory of Everything" (Quantum Gravity).
