## Overview
**Particle Physics** (High Energy Physics) is the quest for the ultimate building blocks of the universe. It smashes atoms together to see what's inside.

## Core Idea
The core idea is **reductionism**. If we understand the smallest things (fundamental particles) and the forces between them, we understand everything.

## Formal Definition
The study of the fundamental constituents of matter and radiation, described by the **Standard Model**.
-   **Fermions (Matter):** Quarks (protons/neutrons) and Leptons (electrons).
-   **Bosons (Forces):** Gluons (Strong), W/Z (Weak), Photons (EM), Higgs (Mass).

## Intuition
It's **cosmic Lego**.
-   **Quarks:** Up and Down quarks stick together (using Gluons) to make Protons and Neutrons.
-   **Electrons:** Orbit the nucleus to make atoms.
-   **Neutrinos:** Ghostly particles that pass through Earth by the trillions.

## Examples
-   **Large Hadron Collider (LHC):** A 27km ring in Switzerland that accelerates protons to near light speed to create new particles (like the Higgs Boson).
-   **Antimatter:** Every particle has an evil twin with opposite charge (Electron vs. Positron). When they meet, they annihilate into pure energy.

## Common Misconceptions
-   **Misconception:** Atoms are the smallest things.
    -   **Correction:** Atoms are made of protons/neutrons, which are made of quarks. Quarks (so far) seem to be point-like (no size).
-   **Misconception:** The "God Particle" (Higgs) proves God.
    -   **Correction:** It's just a nickname (originally "Goddamn Particle" because it was hard to find). It explains why things have mass.

## Related Concepts
-   **[Quantum Mechanics](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/physics/quantum-mechanics.md):** The rules these particles follow.
-   **[Dark Matter](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/physics/dark-matter.md):** Mysterious stuff that makes up 85% of the universe's mass but isn't in the Standard Model.
-   **[String Theory](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/physics/string-theory.md):** A proposed theory that particles are actually tiny vibrating strings.

## Applications
-   **Medicine:** PET scans (Positron Emission Tomography) use antimatter. Proton therapy treats cancer.
-   **World Wide Web:** Invented at CERN by particle physicists to share data.

## Criticism and Limitations
-   **Cost:** Accelerators cost billions.
-   **Incompleteness:** The Standard Model doesn't explain Gravity, Dark Matter, or Dark Energy.
