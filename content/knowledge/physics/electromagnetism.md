## Overview
**Electromagnetism** is the study of electric and magnetic fields. It unified two seemingly different forces (electricity and magnetism) into one, and revealed that **light** is just an electromagnetic wave.

## Core Idea
The core idea is the **Field**. Instead of particles touching each other, they create a "field" in space that pushes and pulls other particles.

## Formal Definition
Governed by **Maxwell's Equations**:
1.  **Gauss's Law:** Electric charges produce electric fields.
2.  **Gauss's Law for Magnetism:** There are no magnetic monopoles (magnets always have N and S).
3.  **Faraday's Law:** Changing magnetic fields create electric fields (induction).
4.  **Ampere-Maxwell Law:** Electric currents and changing electric fields create magnetic fields.

## Intuition
-   **Electricity:** Static charges (like a balloon on hair).
-   **Magnetism:** Moving charges (currents).
-   **Light:** A self-propagating wave where the electric field creates the magnetic field, which creates the electric field... forever.

## Examples
-   **Motors:** Turning electricity into motion (using magnetic fields).
-   **Generators:** Turning motion into electricity (induction).
-   **Radio/WiFi:** Invisible electromagnetic waves carrying information.

## Common Misconceptions
-   **Misconception:** Electrons move at the speed of light in a wire.
    -   **Correction:** They actually drift very slowly (mm/s). The *signal* (field) moves at the speed of light.
-   **Misconception:** North poles attract North poles.
    -   **Correction:** Opposites attract. N attracts S.

## Applications

-   **Medicine:** MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging).

## Criticism and Limitations
-   **Classical Limit:** Like mechanics, classical electromagnetism breaks down at the quantum scale (photons).
