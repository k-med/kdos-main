## Overview
**Cosmology** is the study of the Universe as a whole. Not just the things *in* it, but the container itself. How did it start? How big is it? How will it end?

## Core Idea
The core idea is **expansion**. The universe is getting bigger. This implies that in the past, it was smaller, hotter, and denser (The Big Bang).

## Formal Definition
The study of the large-scale structure and dynamics of the universe. The standard model is the **Lambda-CDM model** (Dark Energy + Cold Dark Matter).

## Intuition
-   **The Balloon Analogy:** Galaxies are dots on a balloon. As you blow it up, the dots move away from each other. There is no "center" of the expansion on the surface.
-   **The Big Bang:** Not an explosion *in* space, but an explosion *of* space.

## Examples
-   **Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB):** The afterglow of the Big Bang. A faint radio static filling the sky, discovered in 1965.
-   **Dark Energy:** A mysterious force pushing the universe apart faster and faster (Accelerating Expansion).
-   **Inflation:** A theory that the universe expanded exponentially fast in the first fraction of a second.

## Common Misconceptions
-   **Misconception:** The Big Bang was the beginning of everything.
    -   **Correction:** It's the beginning of *our current understanding*. We don't know what (if anything) came before $t=0$.
-   **Misconception:** The universe is expanding into something.
    -   **Correction:** The universe is (likely) all there is. It creates space as it grows.

## Related Concepts
-   **[General Relativity](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/physics/relativity.md):** The math of cosmology.
-   **[Particle Physics](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/physics/particle-physics.md):** The early universe was a soup of particles.
-   **[Multiverse](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/physics/multiverse.md):** The idea that our universe is just one of many.

## Applications
-   **Philosophy:** Addressing the "First Cause."
-   **Fundamental Physics:** The universe is the ultimate high-energy lab.

## Criticism and Limitations
-   **Dark Sector:** We don't know what 95% of the universe (Dark Matter + Dark Energy) is. We just know it's there by its gravity.
