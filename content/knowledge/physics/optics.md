## Overview
**Optics** is the study of light. It covers how light moves, how it bounces (reflection), how it bends (refraction), and how we see.

## Core Idea
The core idea is **manipulating light**. By using mirrors and lenses, we can bend light to our will—making distant things look close (telescopes) or small things look big (microscopes).

## Formal Definition
-   **Geometric Optics:** Treating light as rays (lines). Good for lenses and mirrors.
-   **Physical Optics:** Treating light as waves. Good for interference and diffraction.

## Intuition
-   **Reflection:** Light bouncing off a surface (Mirror). Angle in = Angle out.
-   **Refraction:** Light bending when it enters a new medium (Straw looking bent in water).
-   **Dispersion:** White light splitting into a rainbow (Prism).

## Examples
-   **The Eye:** A biological camera with a lens and a retina (sensor).
-   **Lasers:** Coherent light (all waves marching in step). Used for surgery, cutting steel, and internet (fiber optics).
-   **Fiber Optics:** Trapping light inside a glass thread (Total Internal Reflection) to send data across the ocean.

## Common Misconceptions
-   **Misconception:** Objects have color.
    -   **Correction:** Objects *reflect* light. A red apple absorbs all colors except red. In the dark, it has no color.
-   **Misconception:** Light is instantaneous.
    -   **Correction:** It's fast (300,000 km/s), but finite. Looking at stars is looking back in time.

## Related Concepts
-   **[Electromagnetism](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/physics/electromagnetism.md):** Light is an EM wave.
-   **[Photon](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/physics/photon.md):** The particle of light.
-   **[Holography](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/physics/holography.md):** Recording the 3D light field.

## Applications
-   **Astronomy:** Telescopes.
-   **Medicine:** Lasik eye surgery, Endoscopes.
-   **Photography:** Cameras and lenses.

## Criticism and Limitations
-   **Diffraction Limit:** You can't focus light to a spot smaller than its wavelength. This limits the resolution of microscopes (until super-resolution techniques were invented).
