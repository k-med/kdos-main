## Overview
**Relativity** is Einstein's masterpiece. It changed our understanding of space, time, and gravity.
-   **Special Relativity (1905):** Speed of light is constant; time and space are relative.
-   **General Relativity (1915):** Gravity is the curvature of spacetime.

## Core Idea
The core idea is **invariant light speed**. No matter how fast you move, light always passes you at $c$ (300,000 km/s). This forces space and time to warp to keep the math working.

## Formal Definition
-   **Time Dilation:** Moving clocks run slow.
-   **Length Contraction:** Moving objects shrink.
-   **Mass-Energy Equivalence:** $E=mc^2$. Mass and energy are the same thing.
-   **Gravity:** Mass tells spacetime how to curve; spacetime tells mass how to move.

## Intuition
-   **Special:** If you fly past me at 99% light speed, I see you moving in slow motion and squashed flat. You see *me* moving in slow motion and squashed flat. Both are right.
-   **General:** Imagine a bowling ball on a trampoline. It curves the fabric. A marble rolls toward it not because of a "force," but because it's following the curve.

## Examples
-   **GPS:** Satellites move fast (Special Relativity says time slows) and are far from Earth (General Relativity says time speeds up). Engineers must correct for both, or GPS would fail in minutes.
-   **Black Holes:** Gravity so strong that spacetime curves infinitely; not even light can escape.
-   **Twin Paradox:** One twin flies to space, the other stays. The space twin returns younger.

## Common Misconceptions
-   **Misconception:** "Everything is relative."
    -   **Correction:** No. The speed of light is *absolute*. The laws of physics are the same for everyone.
-   **Misconception:** It proves Newton wrong.
    -   **Correction:** It *refines* Newton. At slow speeds (everyday life), Newton is still accurate.

-   **[Cosmology](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/physics/cosmology.md):** The Big Bang is a prediction of General Relativity.
-   **[Gravitational Waves](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/physics/gravitational-waves.md):** Ripples in spacetime caused by colliding black holes (detected in 2015).

## Applications
-   **Nuclear Power:** $E=mc^2$ explains the massive energy in atoms.
-   **Astronomy:** Understanding the universe.

## Criticism and Limitations
-   **Singularities:** The theory breaks down at the center of a black hole (infinite density). It needs Quantum Gravity to fix this.
