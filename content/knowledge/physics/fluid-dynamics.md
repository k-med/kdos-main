## Overview
**Fluid Dynamics** describes how liquids and gases move. It explains everything from blood flow in your veins to the weather, airplanes, and ocean currents.

## Core Idea
The core idea is **continuum mechanics**. Instead of tracking individual water molecules, we treat the fluid as a continuous blob with properties like density, pressure, and velocity.

## Formal Definition
Governed by the **Navier-Stokes Equations** (Newton's laws applied to fluids). These are some of the hardest equations in math.
-   **Bernoulli's Principle:** Faster fluid = Lower pressure. (Why planes fly).

## Intuition
-   **Laminar Flow:** Smooth, orderly flow (honey pouring).
-   **Turbulent Flow:** Chaotic, mixing flow (whitewater rapids, smoke swirling). Turbulence is the great unsolved problem of classical physics.

## Examples
-   **Aerodynamics:** Designing wings to create lift and reduce drag.
-   **Weather Prediction:** The atmosphere is a giant fluid. Modeling it predicts storms.
-   **Blood Pressure:** Understanding how the heart pumps blood through arteries.

## Common Misconceptions
-   **Misconception:** Fluids are just liquids.
    -   **Correction:** Gases (air) are fluids too. Anything that flows.
-   **Misconception:** Wings fly because air travels farther over the top.
    -   **Correction:** The "Equal Transit Time" theory is false. Wings fly because they deflect air downward (Newton's 3rd) and create low pressure on top (Bernoulli).

## Related Concepts
-   **[Viscosity](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/physics/viscosity.md):** A fluid's resistance to flow (thickness).
-   **[Chaos Theory](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/systems/chaos-theory.md):** Turbulence is a chaotic system.
-   **[Reynolds Number](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/physics/reynolds-number.md):** A number that predicts if flow will be laminar or turbulent.

## Applications
-   **Aviation:** Designing planes and rockets.
-   **Climate Science:** Modeling ocean currents (El Niño).
-   **Plumbing:** Designing pipe networks.

## Criticism and Limitations
-   **Computational Cost:** Simulating fluids (CFD) requires massive supercomputers because the math is so hard.
