## Overview
**Logistics** is the boring stuff that wins wars. It's bullets, beans, and bandages. It's getting the right stuff to the right place at the right time.

## Core Idea
The core idea is **Sustainment**. An army marches on its stomach. Without logistics, a tank is just a heavy metal box.

## Formal Definition
The detailed coordination of a complex operation involving many people, facilities, or supplies.

## Intuition
-   **The Iceberg:** Combat is the tip. Logistics is the 90% underwater. For every soldier shooting, there are 10 driving trucks, cooking food, and fixing radios.
-   **The Pipeline:** You need a constant flow of fuel. If the pipeline breaks, the offensive stops.

## Examples
-   **Napoleon:** Failed in Russia because he outran his logistics (scorched earth).
-   **D-Day:** The Mulberry Harbours (artificial ports) were a logistical miracle.
-   **Gulf War:** The "Left Hook" was possible because of GPS and massive logistical capability.

## Common Misconceptions
-   **Misconception:** It's easy.
    -   **Correction:** It is mathematically incredibly hard (Traveling Salesman Problem).
-   **Misconception:** Amateurs talk strategy; professionals talk logistics.
    -   **Correction:** (General Omar Bradley). It's true.

## Criticism and Limitations
