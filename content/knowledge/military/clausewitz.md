## Overview
**Carl von Clausewitz** (1780–1831) is the father of modern Western military strategy. His book *On War* is dense, philosophical, and essential.

## Core Idea
The core idea is **Politics**. "War is the continuation of politics by other means." War is not an end in itself; it is a tool to achieve a political goal.

## Formal Definition
Author of *Vom Kriege* (On War). Famous for concepts like Friction and the Fog of War.

## Intuition
-   **The Fog of War:** In war, everything is uncertain. You can't see over the hill.
-   **Friction:** "Everything in war is very simple, but the simplest thing is difficult." Mud, fear, and broken radios make the plan fail.
-   **Center of Gravity:** The hub of all power and movement, on which everything depends. Strike that.

## Examples
-   **Vietnam War:** The US won the battles (tactics) but lost the war because the political goal was unclear (Clausewitzian failure).
-   **Total War:** Clausewitz predicted the rise of absolute war involving the whole population.

## Common Misconceptions
-   **Misconception:** He loved war.
    -   **Correction:** He analyzed it coldly. He saw it as a terrible act of force.
-   **Misconception:** He advocated "Total War" in a genocidal sense.
    -   **Correction:** He described "Absolute War" as a theoretical extreme, not necessarily a recommendation.

## Related Concepts

-   **[Political Science](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/political-science/international-relations.md):** War belongs to this domain.

## Applications
-   **Strategic Studies:** Every military academy teaches Clausewitz.

## Criticism and Limitations
-   **Complexity:** *On War* is unfinished and contradictory (dialectical).
