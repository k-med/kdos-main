## Overview
**Naval Warfare** is about controlling the commons. The sea is the highway of the world. Whoever controls the sea controls trade, and whoever controls trade controls the world.

## Core Idea
The core idea is **Projection**. A navy allows you to project power anywhere on the globe without needing permission to cross borders.

## Formal Definition
Combat in and on the sea.
-   **Blue Water Navy:** Can operate across the open ocean (US, UK, France).
-   **Green Water Navy:** Coastal defense.

## Intuition
-   **The Choke Point:** Controlling narrow straits (Suez, Malacca, Hormuz) gives you a stranglehold on the global economy.
-   **The Fleet in Being:** Just *having* a fleet scares the enemy, even if it never leaves port.

## Examples
-   **Battle of Trafalgar:** Nelson defeated Napoleon at sea, ensuring Britain ruled the waves for a century.
-   **Battle of Midway:** The turning point of the Pacific War (Aircraft Carriers replaced Battleships).

## Common Misconceptions
-   **Misconception:** It's just ships shooting at each other.
    -   **Correction:** Modern naval warfare is mostly about air power (carriers) and submarines (stealth).
-   **Misconception:** Land power is more important.
    -   **Correction:** "Whosoever commands the sea commands the trade; whosoever commands the trade of the world commands the riches of the world, and consequently the world itself." (Sir Walter Raleigh).

## Related Concepts
-   **[Geopolitics](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/political-science/geopolitics.md):** Mahan's theory of Sea Power.
-   **[Logistics](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/military/logistics.md):** Ships move the stuff.

## Applications
-   **Blockade:** Starving the enemy (e.g., British blockade of Germany in WWI).
-   **Deterrence:** Nuclear submarines.

## Criticism and Limitations
-   **Cost:** Navies are incredibly expensive to build and maintain.
