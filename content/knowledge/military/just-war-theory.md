## Overview
**Just War Theory** is the attempt to restrain the horror of war with morality. It asks: "When is it right to fight?" and "How should we fight?"

## Core Idea
The core idea is **Justice**. War is terrible, but sometimes it is the lesser of two evils.

## Formal Definition
-   **Jus ad Bellum (Justice of War):** When is it right to start a war? (Self-defense, Last Resort, Right Intention).
-   **Jus in Bello (Justice in War):** How must you behave? (Proportionality, Discrimination between civilians and soldiers).

## Intuition
-   **The Policeman:** A policeman can use force, but only to stop a crime, and only as much as necessary. Just War views the soldier as a global policeman.
-   **The Shield:** You fight to protect the innocent, not to conquer.

## Examples
-   **WWII:** Generally considered a Just War (stopping Nazi aggression).
-   **Vietnam/Iraq:** Highly debated. Was there a just cause? Was it a last resort?

## Common Misconceptions
-   **Misconception:** "All's fair in love and war."
    -   **Correction:** That is **Realism**. Just War says there *are* rules (Geneva Conventions).
-   **Misconception:** It's pacifism.
    -   **Correction:** Pacifism says war is *never* right. Just War says it *can* be right.

## Related Concepts
-   **[Ethics](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/philosophy/ethics.md):** The foundation.
-   **[International Law](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/political-science/international-relations.md):** The legal codification of Just War.

## Applications
-   **Rules of Engagement (ROE):** Soldiers are trained on when they can shoot.
-   **War Crimes Tribunals:** Punishing those who break the rules.

## Criticism and Limitations
-   **Subjectivity:** Every side thinks their war is just.
-   **Modern War:** How do you distinguish civilians in a guerrilla war?
