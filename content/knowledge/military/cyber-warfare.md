## Overview
**Cyber Warfare** is the fifth domain (Land, Sea, Air, Space, Cyber). It is the only domain created by humans. It is invisible, fast, and constant.

## Core Idea
The core idea is **Disruption**. You don't need to bomb the power plant if you can hack the control system and make it blow itself up.

## Formal Definition
The use of computer technology to disrupt the activities of a state or organization, especially the deliberate attacking of information systems for strategic or military purposes.

## Intuition
-   **The Glass House:** Modern society lives in a glass house. Everything (banks, hospitals, power grids) is connected. That makes us vulnerable.
-   **The Attribution Problem:** In cyber war, it's hard to know who shot you. Was it Russia? China? Or a fat guy in a basement?

## Examples
-   **Stuxnet:** A US/Israeli worm that physically destroyed Iranian nuclear centrifuges. The first digital weapon to cause physical damage.
-   **NotPetya:** A Russian attack on Ukraine that spread globally and cost billions.

## Common Misconceptions
-   **Misconception:** It's just stealing credit cards.
    -   **Correction:** That's cybercrime. Cyber *warfare* is about destroying infrastructure or stealing state secrets.
-   **Misconception:** There is a "Cyber Pearl Harbor" coming.
    -   **Correction:** Most cyber war is "Gray Zone" conflict—below the threshold of actual war.

## Related Concepts
-   **[Cryptography](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/computer-science/cryptography.md):** The shield.
-   **[Information Warfare](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/military/sun-tzu.md):** Controlling the narrative.

## Applications
-   **Espionage:** Stealing plans for the F-35.
-   **Sabotage:** Turning off the lights.

## Criticism and Limitations
-   **Escalation:** We don't know the rules yet. Does a cyber attack justify a nuclear response?
