## Overview
**Guerrilla Warfare** (Spanish for "Little War") is the weapon of the weak against the strong. It is the flea biting the dog.

## Core Idea
The core idea is **Asymmetry**. You can't win a fair fight, so don't fight fair. Hit and run. Blend into the population.

## Formal Definition
Irregular warfare fought by small, mobile groups against a larger, conventional force.

## Intuition
-   **The Fish and the Water:** "The guerrilla must move amongst the people as a fish swims in the sea." (Mao Zedong). If the people support you, you are invisible.
-   **Death by a Thousand Cuts:** You don't need a knockout blow. You just need to make the war too expensive and painful for the enemy to continue.

## Examples
-   **Vietnam:** The Viet Cong vs. the US Military.
-   **American Revolution:** The colonists used guerrilla tactics against the British.
-   **Afghanistan:** The Graveyard of Empires.

## Common Misconceptions
-   **Misconception:** They are disorganized.
    -   **Correction:** Successful insurgencies are highly organized politically and militarily.
-   **Misconception:** They can't win.
    -   **Correction:** They rarely win *battles*, but they often win *wars* by exhausting the enemy's political will.

## Related Concepts
-   **[Terrorism](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/political-science/terrorism.md):** Often overlaps, but guerrilla warfare targets military, while terrorism targets civilians.
-   **[Sun Tzu](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/military/sun-tzu.md):** The philosophy of the indirect approach.

## Applications
-   **Insurgency/Counter-Insurgency (COIN):** The dominant form of modern conflict.

## Criticism and Limitations
-   **Cost:** It requires immense suffering from the civilian population.
