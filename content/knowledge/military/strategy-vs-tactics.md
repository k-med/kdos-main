## Overview
**Strategy vs. Tactics** is the difference between winning the war and winning the battle. It is the most fundamental distinction in military science (and business).

## Core Idea
The core idea is **Scale**.
-   **Strategy:** The "What" and "Why." Long-term. Large scale.
-   **Tactics:** The "How." Short-term. Small scale.

## Formal Definition
-   **Strategy:** The art of distributing and applying military means to fulfill the ends of policy. (Liddell Hart).
-   **Tactics:** The art of using troops in battle.

## Intuition
-   **The Ladder:** Strategy is deciding which wall to lean the ladder against. Tactics is climbing the ladder efficiently.
-   **Chess:** Strategy is controlling the center of the board. Tactics is a fork that wins a knight.
-   **Sun Tzu:** "Strategy without tactics is the slowest route to victory. Tactics without strategy is the noise before defeat."

## Examples
-   **WWII:**
    -   *Strategy:* "Europe First" (Defeat Germany before Japan).
    -   *Tactics:* Flanking maneuvers on D-Day.
-   **Business:**
    -   *Strategy:* Pivot to AI.
    -   *Tactics:* Hire 50 Python developers.

## Common Misconceptions
-   **Misconception:** They are the same.
    -   **Correction:** You can win every battle (tactics) and lose the war (strategy). (e.g., Vietnam, Hannibal).
-   **Misconception:** Strategy is for generals, tactics for soldiers.
    -   **Correction:** The "Strategic Corporal." In modern war, a single soldier's action can have strategic consequences.

## Related Concepts
-   **[Logistics](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/military/logistics.md):** Strategy is for amateurs; professionals talk logistics.
-   **[Game Theory](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/systems/game-theory.md):** The math of strategy.

## Applications
-   **Management:** Strategic planning vs. daily operations.
-   **Sports:** Game plan vs. play calling.

## Criticism and Limitations
-   **Operational Level:** There is a middle ground called the "Operational Level of War" (Campaigns) that bridges the two.
