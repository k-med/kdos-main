## Overview
**Nuclear Deterrence** is the logic of madness. It kept the peace for 70 years by threatening to end the world.

## Core Idea
The core idea is **Fear**. If you hit me, I will hit you back, and we will both die. Therefore, you won't hit me.

## Formal Definition
A strategy intended to dissuade an adversary from taking an action not yet started by means of the threat of reprisal.
-   **MAD (Mutually Assured Destruction):** The equilibrium where both sides have enough weapons to destroy the other, even after being hit first.

## Intuition
-   **The Scorpions in a Bottle:** Two scorpions in a bottle. If one stings, the other will sting back before it dies. Both die. So neither stings.
-   **The Doomsday Machine:** You need a weapon so terrible that using it is suicide.

## Examples
-   **The Cold War:** USA vs. USSR. They never fought directly because of the bomb.
-   **North Korea:** Wants nukes not to conquer the world, but to prevent the US from invading (Insurance Policy).

## Common Misconceptions
-   **Misconception:** You need more nukes to win.
    -   **Correction:** Once you have enough to destroy the world once, more doesn't help. (Overkill).
-   **Misconception:** Missile Defense is good.
    -   **Correction:** Paradoxically, a perfect shield makes war *more* likely (because one side thinks it can win). This is the **Security Dilemma**.

## Related Concepts
-   **[Game Theory](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/systems/game-theory.md):** The Prisoner's Dilemma and Chicken.
-   **[Ethics](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/philosophy/ethics.md):** Is it moral to threaten to kill millions of civilians?

## Applications
-   **Diplomacy:** The "Nuclear Umbrella."

## Criticism and Limitations
-   **Rationality:** It assumes leaders are rational. What if a suicidal cult gets the bomb?
-   **Accidents:** We almost blew up the world by mistake several times (e.g., Stanislav Petrov).
