## Overview
**Calculus** is the mathematical study of continuous change. It has two major branches: **Differential Calculus** (concerning rates of change and slopes of curves) and **Integral Calculus** (concerning accumulation of quantities and areas under and between curves).

## Core Idea
The core idea is the **Limit**: analyzing what happens as we get infinitely close to a point. This allows us to handle the concept of "instantaneous" change (speed at a specific moment) and "infinite" sums.

## Formal Definition
Calculus relies on the rigorous definition of a limit ($\epsilon-\delta$ definition).
-   **Derivative ($f'(x)$):** The limit of the difference quotient as the interval approaches zero.
-   **Integral ($\int f(x) dx$):** The limit of a Riemann sum as the partition size approaches zero.

## Intuition
-   **Differentiation:** Zooming in on a curve until it looks like a straight line. The slope of that line is the derivative.
-   **Integration:** Slicing a shape into infinitely thin rectangles and adding up their areas to get the total area.

## Examples
-   **Physics:** Velocity is the derivative of position. Acceleration is the derivative of velocity. Distance is the integral of velocity.
-   **Optimization:** Finding the maximum profit or minimum cost by setting the derivative to zero (finding the peak of the curve).

## Common Misconceptions
-   **Misconception:** Zeno's paradoxes prove motion is impossible.
    -   **Correction:** Calculus resolves Zeno's paradoxes by showing that an infinite sum of time intervals can add up to a finite total.
-   **Misconception:** Derivatives and integrals are unrelated.
    -   **Correction:** The **Fundamental Theorem of Calculus** connects them: integration and differentiation are inverse operations.

## Related Concepts
-   **[Limit](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/mathematics/limit.md):** The value that a function (or sequence) "approaches" as the input (or index) approaches some value.
-   **[Continuity](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/mathematics/continuity.md):** A function is continuous if you can draw it without lifting your pen.
-   **[Differential Equations](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/mathematics/differential-equations.md):** Equations involving derivatives.

## Applications
-   **Physics & Engineering:** Describing motion, electricity, heat, structures.
-   **Economics:** Marginal cost/revenue analysis.
-   **Biology:** Modeling population growth (logistic curves).

## Criticism and Limitations
-   **Discreteness:** Calculus assumes the world is continuous (smooth). At the quantum scale, or in digital computing, the world is discrete, requiring Discrete Math instead.
