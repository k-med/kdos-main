## Overview
Stoichiometry is the math of chemistry. It allows chemists to predict how much product will form from a given amount of reactant, or how much reactant is needed to make a specific amount of product.

## Core Idea
**Mole Ratio:** The coefficients in a balanced chemical equation tell you the ratio of moles of each substance.
$$ 2H_2 + O_2 \rightarrow 2H_2O $$
(2 moles of Hydrogen + 1 mole of Oxygen $\rightarrow$ 2 moles of Water)

## Formal Definition (if applicable)
**Mole:** The SI unit for amount of substance ($6.022 \times 10^{23}$ particles).
**Limiting Reactant:** The reactant that is completely consumed first, limiting the amount of product formed.

## Intuition
It's like a recipe. If a sandwich needs 2 slices of bread and 1 slice of cheese, and you have 10 slices of bread but only 3 slices of cheese, you can only make 3 sandwiches. The cheese is the limiting reactant.

## Examples
- **Baking:** Calculating how much flour you need for 50 cookies.
- **Industrial Chemistry:** Calculating how much raw material is needed to produce a ton of fertilizer.
- **Airbags:** Calculating the exact amount of chemical needed to inflate the bag instantly without exploding.

## Common Misconceptions
- "1 gram of A reacts with 1 gram of B." (No! You must convert to moles first because atoms have different masses.)
- "The reaction stops when all reactants are gone." (It stops when the *limiting* reactant is gone.)

## Related Concepts
- **Molar Mass:** The mass of one mole of a substance.
- **Percent Yield:** (Actual Yield / Theoretical Yield) $\times$ 100%.
- **Concentration (Molarity):** Moles per liter.

## Applications
- **Pharmacology:** Dosing medications correctly.
- **Environmental Science:** Calculating pollution levels.
- **Rocketry:** Mixing fuel and oxidizer in the perfect ratio.

## Criticism / Limitations
Stoichiometry assumes ideal conditions. In reality, side reactions, incomplete reactions, and impurities often reduce the actual yield.
