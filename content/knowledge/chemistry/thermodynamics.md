## Overview
Thermodynamics tells us *if* a reaction will happen (spontaneity) and how much energy it involves. It deals with macroscopic properties like temperature, pressure, and volume.

## Core Idea
**First Law:** Energy cannot be created or destroyed (Conservation of Energy).
**Second Law:** The entropy of the universe always increases (Disorder tends to increase).

## Formal Definition (if applicable)
**Gibbs Free Energy ($\Delta G$):** A measure of the maximum reversible work that may be performed by a thermodynamic system.
$$ \Delta G = \Delta H - T\Delta S $$
If $\Delta G < 0$, the reaction is spontaneous.

## Intuition
- **Enthalpy ($\Delta H$):** Heat content. Is the reaction releasing heat (burning wood) or absorbing it (melting ice)?
- **Entropy ($\Delta S$):** Disorder. Is the room getting messier (gas expanding) or cleaner (crystal forming)?
- Nature prefers low energy (exothermic) and high disorder (high entropy).

## Examples
- **Combustion:** Highly exothermic (releases heat) and increases entropy (solid wood $\rightarrow$ gas). Very spontaneous.
- **Ice Melting:** Endothermic (absorbs heat) but increases entropy. Spontaneous above 0°C.
- **Photosynthesis:** Non-spontaneous (requires energy input from the sun).

## Common Misconceptions
- "Spontaneous means fast." (No, spontaneous means it *can* happen without external energy. Rusting is spontaneous but slow. Speed is Kinetics, not Thermodynamics.)
- "Entropy is just messiness." (It's statistically defined as the number of microstates.)

## Related Concepts
- **Equilibrium:** When the forward and reverse reaction rates are equal ($\Delta G = 0$).
- **Heat Capacity:** How much energy is needed to raise temperature.
- **Calorimetry:** Measuring heat changes.

## Applications
- **Engines:** Maximizing efficiency of heat-to-work conversion.
- **Batteries:** Storing chemical energy.
- **Refrigeration:** Moving heat against the gradient.

## Criticism / Limitations
Thermodynamics predicts the final state but says nothing about how long it takes to get there. Diamond turning into graphite is thermodynamically favorable but kinetically impossible at room temperature.
