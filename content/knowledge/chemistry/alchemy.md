  Alchemy is an ancient branch of natural philosophy, a philosophical and protoscientific tradition practiced throughout Europe, Africa, and Asia. It aimed to purify, mature, and perfect certain objects. Common aims were chrysopoeia, the transmutation of "base metals" (e.g., lead) into "noble metals" (particularly gold); the creation of an elixir of immortality; and the creation of panaceas able to cure any disease.

## Overview
Before there was Chemistry, there was Alchemy. It was a mix of science, magic, and religion. Alchemists were trying to do three things: turn lead into gold, find the Elixir of Life, and discover the Philosopher's Stone. They failed at all three, but in the process, they invented the lab equipment we use today.

## Core Idea
The core idea is **Transmutation**. The belief that matter is not fixed. You can "perfect" a metal just like you can perfect a soul. Lead is just "sick" Gold. If you cure it, it becomes Gold.

## Formal Definition
A protoscientific tradition practiced throughout antiquity.
**Magnum Opus:** The Great Work. The process of creating the Philosopher's Stone.

## Intuition
-   **Chemist:** "Lead is Element 82. Gold is Element 79. You can't change protons with a furnace."
-   **Alchemist:** "Lead is unrefined spirit. If I burn away the impurities, the Gold hidden inside will be revealed."

## Examples
-   **Isaac Newton:** The greatest scientist ever was actually a closet alchemist. He wrote more about alchemy than physics. He spent years looking for the Philosopher's Stone.
-   **Phosphorus:** Discovered by Hennig Brand. He was trying to make gold out of urine (because it was yellow). He boiled 1,500 gallons of pee. He didn't get gold, but he got a glowing white paste (Phosphorus).
-   **Distillation:** Alchemists invented the still to make "Aqua Vitae" (Water of Life), which was just high-proof alcohol.

## Common Misconceptions
-   **They were fools:** No, they were smart people working with the wrong theory. They didn't know about atoms.
-   **It's just magic:** It was practical. They made dyes, medicines, and alloys.

## Related Concepts
-   **Hermeticism:** The spiritual philosophy behind alchemy. "As above, so below."
-   **Chemistry:** The child that killed its parent. Boyle and Lavoisier took the tools of alchemy but threw away the mysticism.

## Applications
-   **Metaphor:** Jung used alchemy as a metaphor for psychology. Turning the "lead" of your trauma into the "gold" of wisdom.

## Criticism / Limitations
-   **Secrecy:** Alchemists wrote in code to hide their secrets. This stopped knowledge from spreading. Science requires openness (publishing papers).
