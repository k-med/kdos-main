  Atomic structure refers to the composition of an atom, which consists of a nucleus containing protons and neutrons, surrounded by electrons in orbitals. It is the foundation of all matter.

## Overview
Everything in the universe is made of atoms. Understanding their structure explains why elements behave the way they do and how they bond to form molecules.

## Core Idea
An atom is mostly empty space. At the center is a dense **nucleus** (protons + neutrons), and orbiting around it are **electrons** in specific energy levels.

## Formal Definition (if applicable)
**Atomic Number (Z):** The number of protons in the nucleus (defines the element).
**Mass Number (A):** The total number of protons and neutrons.

## Intuition
Imagine a football stadium. The nucleus is a marble on the 50-yard line. The electrons are tiny gnats buzzing around the highest seats. The rest is empty space.

## Examples
- **Hydrogen:** The simplest atom (1 proton, 1 electron).
- **Isotopes:** Atoms of the same element with different numbers of neutrons (e.g., Carbon-12 vs. Carbon-14).
- **Ions:** Atoms that have gained or lost electrons (charged).

## Common Misconceptions
- "Electrons orbit like planets." (The Bohr model is a simplification; electrons actually exist in probability clouds called orbitals.)
- "Atoms are solid balls." (They are fuzzy clouds of probability.)

## Related Concepts
- **Quantum Mechanics:** The physics describing electron behavior.
- **Periodic Table:** Organizing elements by atomic structure.
- **Valence Electrons:** The outermost electrons involved in bonding.

## Applications
- **Nuclear Energy:** Splitting the nucleus to release energy.
- **MRI:** Using magnetic fields to align hydrogen nuclei in the body.
- **Chemistry:** Predicting how elements react based on electron configuration.

## Criticism / Limitations
Classical models (like Bohr's) fail to explain complex electron behavior, requiring quantum mechanical models (Schrödinger equation) for accuracy.
