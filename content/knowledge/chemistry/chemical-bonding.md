  Chemical bonding is the attraction between atoms that allows the formation of chemical substances containing two or more atoms. The bond is caused by the electrostatic force of attraction between opposite charges.

## Overview
Atoms bond to achieve a stable electron configuration (usually a full outer shell, like noble gases). The type of bond determines the properties of the substance (e.g., why salt is brittle and metal is bendable).

## Core Idea
**Octet Rule:** Atoms tend to gain, lose, or share electrons to have 8 electrons in their outer shell.

## Formal Definition (if applicable)
**Ionic Bond:** Electrostatic attraction between ions of opposite charge (transfer of electrons).
**Covalent Bond:** Sharing of electron pairs between atoms.
**Metallic Bond:** Attraction between metal ions and delocalized electrons.

## Intuition
- **Ionic:** One atom gives an electron to another (like giving a gift). They stick together because they are now oppositely charged magnets.
- **Covalent:** Two atoms share electrons (like holding hands).
- **Metallic:** A sea of electrons flows around positive cores (like a communal pool).

## Examples
- **Salt (NaCl):** Ionic bond.
- **Water ($H_2O$):** Covalent bond.
- **Copper Wire:** Metallic bond.

## Common Misconceptions
- "Bonds are physical sticks." (They are forces of attraction.)
- "Ionic bonds are weaker than covalent." (Ionic bonds are very strong in a lattice, but dissolve easily in water.)

## Related Concepts
- **Electronegativity:** A measure of how strongly an atom attracts electrons.
- **Polarity:** Uneven sharing of electrons in a covalent bond.
- **VSEPR Theory:** Predicting the 3D shape of molecules.

## Applications
- **Materials Science:** Designing new materials with specific properties.
- **Drug Design:** Understanding how drugs bind to receptors.
- **Nanotechnology:** Manipulating bonds at the atomic scale.

## Criticism / Limitations
The Octet Rule has many exceptions (e.g., Boron, Sulfur). Simple bonding models don't explain everything (like resonance or molecular orbitals).
