## Overview
While thermodynamics asks "will it happen?", kinetics asks "how fast?" and "by what path?". It focuses on the speed of chemical processes and the steps involved.

## Core Idea
**Collision Theory:** For a reaction to occur, particles must collide with:
1.  Correct orientation.
2.  Sufficient energy (**Activation Energy, $E_a$**).

## Formal Definition (if applicable)
**Rate Law:** An equation that links the reaction rate with the concentrations or pressures of the reactants and constant parameters.
$$ \text{Rate} = k[A]^m[B]^n $$

## Intuition
Imagine trying to start a fire. You need the wood and air to touch (collision). You need a spark (activation energy) to get it over the hump. A catalyst (lighter fluid) lowers the hump, making it start easier and faster.

## Examples
- **Rusting:** A slow reaction.
- **Explosion:** A very fast reaction.
- **Enzymes:** Biological catalysts that speed up reactions in the body by millions of times.

## Common Misconceptions
- "Increasing temperature always increases rate." (True for most reactions because particles move faster and hit harder, but there are exceptions like enzyme denaturation.)
- "Catalysts are used up." (Catalysts participate in the reaction but are regenerated at the end.)

## Related Concepts
- **Half-Life:** The time it takes for half the reactant to be consumed.
- **Reaction Mechanism:** The step-by-step sequence of elementary reactions.
- **Transition State:** The high-energy, unstable state during a collision.

## Applications
- **Industrial Chemistry:** Optimizing production rates (e.g., Haber process for ammonia).
- **Pharmacology:** Controlling how fast a drug is metabolized.
- **Food Preservation:** Slowing down spoilage reactions (refrigeration).

## Criticism / Limitations
Determining the exact mechanism is often difficult and requires complex experiments; rate laws are empirical and can't always be predicted from the equation alone.
