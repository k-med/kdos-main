  Acids and bases are two types of corrosive substances that react with each other to form salts. Their behavior is fundamental to many chemical and biological processes.

## Overview
Acids taste sour (lemon) and turn litmus red. Bases taste bitter (soap) and turn litmus blue. When mixed, they neutralize each other.

## Core Idea
**pH Scale:** A logarithmic scale measuring acidity. pH 7 is neutral. pH < 7 is acidic. pH > 7 is basic (alkaline).
$$ \text{pH} = -\log[H^+] $$

## Formal Definition (if applicable)
**Brønsted-Lowry Theory:**
- **Acid:** Proton ($H^+$) donor.
- **Base:** Proton ($H^+$) acceptor.

**Lewis Theory:**
- **Acid:** Electron pair acceptor.
- **Base:** Electron pair donor.

## Intuition
An acid is like a person trying to get rid of a hot potato ($H^+$). A base is a person willing to catch it. Water can act as both (amphoteric).

## Examples
- **Acids:** Hydrochloric acid (stomach acid), Acetic acid (vinegar), Citric acid (lemons).
- **Bases:** Sodium hydroxide (drain cleaner), Ammonia (cleaner), Sodium bicarbonate (baking soda).
- **Buffer:** A solution that resists changes in pH (e.g., blood).

## Common Misconceptions
- "Acids burn, bases are safe." (Strong bases like lye are just as dangerous and corrosive as strong acids.)
- "pH ranges from 0 to 14." (It can actually go below 0 or above 14 for very concentrated solutions.)

## Related Concepts
- **Titration:** A method to determine concentration by neutralizing.
- **Dissociation:** How well an acid splits into ions (Strong vs. Weak acids).
- **Conjugate Pair:** An acid and its corresponding base (e.g., $HCl$ and $Cl^-$).

## Applications
- **Biology:** Enzymes only work at specific pH levels.
- **Environment:** Acid rain damages ecosystems.
- **Industry:** Manufacturing fertilizers, dyes, and explosives.

## Criticism / Limitations
The Arrhenius definition (acids produce $H^+$, bases produce $OH^-$) is too limited (doesn't explain ammonia). Brønsted-Lowry and Lewis definitions are broader.
