  Catalysis is the process of increasing the rate of a chemical reaction by adding a substance known as a catalyst. Catalysts are not consumed in the reaction and remain unchanged after it. If the reaction is rapid and the catalyst recycles quickly, very small amounts of catalyst often suffice.

## Overview
Imagine trying to push a car over a hill. It's hard work. Now imagine digging a tunnel through the hill. It's much easier. A catalyst is that tunnel. It provides a shortcut (lower activation energy) for a chemical reaction to happen. Without catalysts, most reactions in your body and in factories would be too slow to sustain life or industry.

## Core Idea
The core idea is **Lowering Activation Energy**. Every reaction has an energy barrier (the "hill") it must climb to get started. A catalyst lowers the height of that hill, so more molecules can jump over it.

## Formal Definition
The increase in the rate of a chemical reaction by the participation of an additional substance called a catalyst, which is not consumed by the reaction.

## Intuition
-   **No Catalyst:** Walking from New York to London (Impossible/Too Slow).
-   **Catalyst:** Taking a plane (Fast/Easy). The plane helps you get there, but the plane itself isn't "used up" (it flies back to take more passengers).

## Examples
-   **Catalytic Converter:** The device in your car exhaust. It uses Platinum to turn toxic Carbon Monoxide (CO) into safe Carbon Dioxide (CO2). It does this in milliseconds.
-   **Enzymes:** Biological catalysts. *Amylase* in your spit turns starch into sugar instantly. Without it, digesting a potato would take weeks.
-   **Haber Process:** The most important reaction in history. It uses an Iron catalyst to turn air (Nitrogen) into fertilizer (Ammonia). It feeds 50% of the world's population.

## Common Misconceptions
-   **Catalysts make impossible reactions happen:** No, they only speed up reactions that are already possible (thermodynamically favorable). They can't break the laws of physics.
-   **They last forever:** They can get "poisoned" (clogged up) by impurities (like lead in gasoline poisoning a catalytic converter).

## Related Concepts
-   **Heterogeneous Catalysis:** The catalyst is a solid (metal) and the reactants are gas/liquid. (Most industrial processes).
-   **Homogeneous Catalysis:** Everything is in the same phase (liquid soup).

## Applications
-   **Green Chemistry:** efficient catalysts mean we can run factories at lower temperatures, saving massive amounts of energy.

## Criticism / Limitations
-   **Cost:** Many best catalysts are made of precious metals (Platinum, Palladium, Rhodium), which are expensive and rare.
