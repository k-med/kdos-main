## Overview
Traditional chemistry was dirty. "The solution to pollution is dilution" (just dump it in the river). Green Chemistry is a paradigm shift. It says: Don't make the mess in the first place. Design the chemical reaction so that it is safe, efficient, and produces no toxic waste. It is chemistry with a conscience.

## Core Idea
The core idea is **Prevention**. It is better to prevent waste than to treat or clean up waste after it is formed.

## Formal Definition
The design of chemical products and processes that reduce or eliminate the use or generation of hazardous substances. Defined by the **12 Principles of Green Chemistry** (Anastas & Warner).

## Intuition
-   **Old Way:** Making a cake, but throwing away half the flour and eggs, and leaving the kitchen covered in grease.
-   **Green Way:** Using a recipe where every gram of flour ends up in the cake (Atom Economy), using water instead of oil to clean up (Safe Solvents), and baking at a lower temperature (Energy Efficiency).

## Examples
-   **Ibuprofen:** The old way to make this drug wasted 60% of the atoms. The new "Green" method uses 99% of the atoms. It saves millions of pounds of waste every year.
-   **Decaf Coffee:** We used to use Benzene (a carcinogen) to remove caffeine. Now we use "Supercritical CO2" (liquid carbon dioxide). It is non-toxic and evaporates completely, leaving no residue.
-   **Biodegradable Packing Peanuts:** Made from starch instead of Styrofoam. You can dissolve them in water.

## Common Misconceptions
-   **It's expensive:** It often saves money because you buy fewer raw materials and don't have to pay to dispose of toxic waste.
-   **It's just for hippies:** It is adopted by major corporations (Dow, DuPont, Pfizer) because it is good business.

## Related Concepts
-   **Atom Economy:** A metric: (Mass of Product / Mass of Reactants) * 100. Ideally, it should be 100%.
-   **Catalysis:** Using a catalyst allows a reaction to happen at lower heat and faster, saving energy.

## Applications
-   **Paint:** Low-VOC (Volatile Organic Compound) paints that don't smell and don't give you headaches.
-   **Dry Cleaning:** Replacing PERC (a toxin) with liquid CO2.

## Criticism / Limitations
-   **Inertia:** It is hard to change industrial processes that have been used for 50 years. It requires new equipment and training.
