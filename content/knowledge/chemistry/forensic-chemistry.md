## Overview
CSI is not real life. In real life, you don't get a result in 5 minutes with flashy graphics. But Forensic Chemistry is still cool. It is the science of using molecules as evidence. Was that white powder cocaine or sugar? Was there poison in the victim's coffee? Did the fire start with gasoline? Chemistry answers these questions.

## Core Idea
The core idea is **Trace Analysis**. Every contact leaves a trace (Locard's Exchange Principle). A criminal leaves behind sweat, hair, soil, or gunshot residue. A chemist finds these microscopic traces and identifies them.

## Formal Definition
The application of chemical principles, techniques, and methods to the investigation of crime.

## Intuition
-   **The Detective:** Asks "Who did it?"
-   **The Forensic Chemist:** Asks "What is this substance?" and "Does it match the suspect?" They provide the scientific fact that backs up the theory.

## Examples
-   **Fingerprints:** We use Cyanoacrylate (Super Glue) fuming to reveal invisible fingerprints. The glue fumes stick to the oils in the print and turn white.
-   **Luminol:** A chemical that glows blue when it touches blood (even if the blood has been bleached). It reacts with the Iron in hemoglobin.
-   **Arson Investigation:** A house burns down. The chemist takes a piece of charred wood, puts it in a machine (Gas Chromatography), and sees a spike for "Gasoline." This proves it wasn't an accident.

## Common Misconceptions
-   **The "Match":** Chemistry rarely says "This came from THAT specific gun." It says "This is consistent with that type of gun." It deals in probabilities, not absolute certainties.
-   **Instant DNA:** DNA analysis takes days or weeks, not minutes.

## Related Concepts
-   **Toxicology:** The study of poisons and drugs in the body. (e.g., finding out if a driver was drunk or high).
-   **Chain of Custody:** The legal rule that says you must track who touched the evidence at every second. If you break the chain, the evidence is thrown out of court.

## Applications
-   **Art Forgery:** Testing the paint on a "Van Gogh." If the paint contains Titanium White (invented in 1921), it's a fake because Van Gogh died in 1890.
-   **Doping in Sports:** Testing urine for steroids.

## Criticism / Limitations
-   **The CSI Effect:** Juries now expect scientific proof for every crime. If there is no DNA, they often acquit the suspect, even if there is other evidence.
