## Overview
Electrochemistry powers our world. It explains how batteries store energy, how metals corrode, and how we can plate gold onto cheap metal.

## Core Idea
**Redox (Reduction-Oxidation) Reactions:** Reactions where electrons are transferred.
- **Oxidation:** Loss of electrons (OIL).
- **Reduction:** Gain of electrons (RIG).
**OIL RIG:** Oxidation Is Loss, Reduction Is Gain.

## Formal Definition (if applicable)
**Galvanic Cell (Voltaic Cell):** A device that converts chemical energy into electrical energy (spontaneous).
**Electrolytic Cell:** A device that uses electrical energy to drive a non-spontaneous chemical reaction.

## Intuition
Think of a waterfall. Water falling (electrons flowing) releases energy that can turn a turbine (do work). A battery is a chemical waterfall. Recharging a battery is like pumping the water back up to the top.

## Examples
- **Lithium-ion Batteries:** Powering phones and electric cars.
- **Corrosion (Rust):** Iron oxidizing to form iron oxide.
- **Electroplating:** Coating jewelry with gold or silver.

## Common Misconceptions
- "Anode is always positive." (In a battery/galvanic cell, the anode is negative. In an electrolytic cell, it's positive. But oxidation *always* happens at the anode.)
- "Electrons flow through the salt bridge." (Ions flow through the salt bridge; electrons flow through the wire.)

## Related Concepts
- **Standard Reduction Potential ($E^\circ$):** A measure of how much a substance wants to gain electrons.
- **Nernst Equation:** Calculating voltage under non-standard conditions.
- **Faraday's Laws:** Relating charge to amount of substance.

## Applications
- **Energy Storage:** Developing better batteries for renewable energy.
- **Metallurgy:** Extracting aluminum from ore (Hall-Héroult process).
- **Neuroscience:** Nerve impulses are electrochemical signals.

## Criticism / Limitations
Batteries degrade over time due to unwanted side reactions. Storing large amounts of energy efficiently remains a major technological challenge.
