## Overview
Carbon is unique because it can form four stable bonds, allowing for infinite chains, rings, and complex 3D structures. This versatility is the basis of life and millions of synthetic materials.

## Core Idea
**Functional Groups:** Specific groups of atoms (like -OH for alcohols, -COOH for acids) that determine the chemical reactivity of a molecule, regardless of the size of the carbon chain.

## Formal Definition (if applicable)
**Isomers:** Molecules with the same molecular formula but different structural arrangements (e.g., butane and isobutane).

## Intuition
Think of carbon atoms as Lego bricks that can snap together in any direction. Hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen are other specialized bricks. Organic chemistry is the art of building specific structures (like a drug molecule) from these bricks.

## Examples
- **Hydrocarbons:** Fuels like methane (natural gas), propane, and octane (gasoline).
- **Polymers:** Plastics like polyethylene and PVC.
- **Biomolecules:** Proteins, DNA, and carbohydrates are all organic.

## Common Misconceptions
- "Organic means natural/pesticide-free." (In chemistry, it just means "contains carbon." Cyanide and plastic are organic.)
- "It's just memorization." (It's actually about understanding electron flow and mechanism patterns.)

## Related Concepts
- **Stereochemistry:** The study of the 3D arrangement of atoms (chirality).
- **Resonance:** Delocalization of electrons in molecules like benzene.
- **Synthesis:** The process of building complex molecules from simpler ones.

## Applications
- **Pharmaceuticals:** Designing and manufacturing drugs.
- **Petrochemicals:** Refining oil into fuels and plastics.
- **Agriculture:** Creating pesticides and fertilizers.

## Criticism / Limitations
Organic synthesis can be wasteful and polluting (solvents, byproducts). "Green Chemistry" aims to make these processes more sustainable.
