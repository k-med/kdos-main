  Stereochemistry, a subdiscipline of chemistry, involves the study of the relative spatial arrangement of atoms that form the structure of molecules and their manipulation. The study of stereochemistry focuses on stereoisomers, which by definition have the same molecular formula and sequence of bonded atoms (constitution), but differ in the three-dimensional orientations of their atoms in space.

## Overview
Molecules are 3D objects. Just like your left hand and your right hand are mirror images but not identical (you can't put a left glove on a right hand), molecules can have "handedness." This is called **Chirality**. Stereochemistry is the study of how this 3D shape affects how molecules work.

## Core Idea
The core idea is **Shape Matters**. Two molecules can have the exact same atoms connected in the exact same order, but if one is "Left-Handed" (L) and the other is "Right-Handed" (D), they can have completely different effects in the body.

## Formal Definition
The study of the relative spatial arrangement of atoms that form the structure of molecules.
-   **Enantiomers:** Mirror-image pairs (Left vs. Right).
-   **Diastereomers:** Non-mirror image stereoisomers.

## Intuition
Imagine shaking hands.
-   Right hand + Right hand = Good fit (Reaction happens).
-   Right hand + Left hand = Awkward (No reaction).
Your body is made of "Right-handed" proteins and "Left-handed" sugars. It is a chiral environment. So drugs need to be the correct "hand" to work.

## Examples
-   **Thalidomide Tragedy:** In the 1950s, a drug was sold for morning sickness. One enantiomer cured nausea. The mirror image caused horrible birth defects (missing limbs). The factory made a mixture of both. This tragedy birthed modern drug safety regulations.
-   **Lemons vs. Oranges:** The molecule Limonene smells like lemons. Its mirror image smells like oranges. Your nose receptors are chiral, so they can tell the difference.
-   **Methamphetamine:** One version is a dangerous illegal drug (Crystal Meth). The mirror image is sold over-the-counter in Vicks VapoInhaler for stuffy noses.

## Common Misconceptions
-   **Molecules are flat:** We draw them flat on paper, but they are tetrahedrons, pyramids, and rings. You have to think in 3D.

## Related Concepts
-   **Racemic Mixture:** A 50/50 mix of left and right versions.
-   **Optical Activity:** Chiral molecules rotate polarized light. One rotates it clockwise (+), the other counter-clockwise (-). This is how we measure purity.

## Applications
-   **Pharmaceuticals:** Today, the FDA requires drug companies to separate the enantiomers and test them individually (Chiral Switching).

## Criticism / Limitations
-   **Difficulty:** Separating left and right molecules is incredibly hard because they have the same boiling point and solubility. You need special chiral catalysts.
