## Overview
If organic chemistry is the study of carbon, inorganic chemistry is the study of the rest of the periodic table. It includes metals, minerals, and organometallic compounds.

## Core Idea
**Coordination Compounds:** A central metal atom surrounded by non-metal atoms or groups called **ligands**. The color of gemstones and blood comes from these complexes.

## Formal Definition (if applicable)
**Crystal Field Theory:** A model that describes the breaking of degeneracies of electron orbital states, usually d or f orbitals, due to a static electric field produced by a surrounding charge distribution (anion neighbors).

## Intuition
Metals are the "social butterflies" of chemistry. They can bond with almost anything, often in complex, colorful geometries. Hemoglobin is an iron complex that grabs oxygen; chlorophyll is a magnesium complex that grabs light.

## Examples
- **Catalysts:** Platinum in catalytic converters cleans car exhaust.
- **Semiconductors:** Silicon chips in computers.
- **Pigments:** Titanium dioxide (white paint), Prussian Blue.

## Common Misconceptions
- "Inorganic means non-living." (Many biological molecules, like hemoglobin and metalloenzymes, contain inorganic centers essential for life—Bioinorganic Chemistry.)
- "It's just rocks." (It includes high-tech materials, superconductors, and medicine.)

## Related Concepts
- **Ligand:** An ion or molecule that binds to a central metal atom.
- **Oxidation State:** The hypothetical charge of an atom.
- **Symmetry:** Essential for understanding molecular orbitals and spectroscopy.

## Applications
- **Medicine:** Cisplatin is a platinum-based anti-cancer drug.
- **Materials Science:** Superconductors, ceramics, and alloys.
- **Energy:** Solar cells and fuel cells rely on inorganic materials.

## Criticism / Limitations
The boundary between organic and inorganic is blurry (Organometallic chemistry). Toxicity of heavy metals is a major concern.
