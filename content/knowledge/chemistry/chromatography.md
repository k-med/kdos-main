summary: >
  Chromatography is a laboratory technique for the separation of a mixture. The mixture is dissolved in a fluid (gas, solvent, water, ...) called the mobile phase, which carries it through a system (a column, a capillary tube, a plate, or a sheet) on which is fixed a material called the stationary phase.

## Overview
If you spill water on black ink, it separates into blue, red, and purple colors. That is Chromatography ("Color Writing"). It is the most important tool for separating mixtures. Whether you are testing urine for drugs or purifying a vaccine, you are using chromatography.

## Core Idea
The core idea is **Differential Partitioning**. It's a race.
-   **Stationary Phase:** The sticky floor (Paper/Silica).
-   **Mobile Phase:** The wind (Solvent).
The molecules that like the floor move slow. The molecules that like the wind move fast. They separate based on speed.

## Formal Definition
A physical method of separation that distributes components between two phases: one stationary, one mobile.

## Intuition
Imagine a group of people running through a shopping mall.
-   **Mobile Phase:** The flow of the crowd.
-   **Stationary Phase:** The shops.
-   **Separation:** People who like shopping (High Affinity) stop at every store and finish the race last. People who hate shopping (Low Affinity) run straight through and finish first.

## Examples
-   **Paper Chromatography:** The school experiment. Ink on filter paper.
-   **HPLC (High-Performance Liquid Chromatography):** The workhorse of the pharmaceutical industry. Pumping liquid through a steel tube packed with microscopic beads at high pressure. It can separate molecules that differ by a single atom.
-   **Gas Chromatography (GC):** Vaporizing the sample and running it through a long coil of wire. Used for testing alcohol, perfumes, and arson debris.

## Common Misconceptions
-   **It identifies things:** No, it only *separates* them. You need a detector (like a Mass Spectrometer) at the end to tell you what the separated things *are*.

## Related Concepts
-   **Retention Time:** How long it takes for a molecule to come out of the column. This is its ID card.
-   **TLC (Thin Layer Chromatography):** A quick and dirty version used by organic chemists to check if their reaction worked.

## Applications
-   **Drug Testing:** The Olympics lab uses GC-MS to find steroids in urine.
-   **Vaccine Purification:** You grow the virus in a vat of goop. You use chromatography to grab only the virus and wash away the goop.

## Criticism / Limitations
-   **Cost:** HPLC columns are expensive ($500+) and get clogged easily.
