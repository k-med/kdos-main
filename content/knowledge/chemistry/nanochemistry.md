  Nanochemistry is the combination of chemistry and nanoscience. Nanochemistry is associated with synthesis of building blocks which are dependent on size, surface, shape and defect properties. Nanochemistry is being used in chemical, materials and physical, science as well as engineering, biological and medical applications.

## Overview
Size matters. Gold is usually yellow and shiny. But if you chop gold into tiny pieces (nanoparticles), it turns red or purple. Why? Because at the nanoscale (1-100 nanometers), the rules of physics change. Quantum effects take over. Nanochemistry is the study of materials at this weird, tiny scale.

## Core Idea
The core idea is **Surface Area to Volume Ratio**. A nanoparticle is almost all surface. This makes it incredibly reactive. It also interacts with light in new ways (Plasmonics).

## Formal Definition
The synthesis and characterization of materials at the nanometer scale (1 billionth of a meter).

## Intuition
-   **Bulk Gold:** A brick. Inert. Boring.
-   **Nano Gold:** A cloud of dust. Reactive. Colorful. Used to kill cancer.
It's the same element, but a different behavior.

## Examples
-   **Quantum Dots:** Tiny semiconductor crystals. If you make them 2nm wide, they glow blue. Make them 6nm wide, they glow red. We use them in QLED TVs for perfect color.
-   **Sunscreen:** Zinc Oxide used to be a thick white paste (lifeguard nose). Now we use Nano-Zinc. The particles are so small they are invisible (transparent), but they still block UV rays.
-   **Stained Glass:** The beautiful red colors in medieval church windows are actually Gold nanoparticles. The monks were the first nanotechnologists (without knowing it).

## Common Misconceptions
-   **It's sci-fi:** It's already in your phone, your clothes (stain-resistant pants), and your tennis racket (carbon nanotubes).
-   **Grey Goo:** The fear that self-replicating nanobots will eat the world. This is fiction. Real nanotech is about materials, not robots.

## Related Concepts
-   **Graphene:** A single layer of graphite (carbon). It is the strongest material ever discovered, conductive, and transparent. It is the "Wonder Material" of nanochemistry.
-   **Carbon Nanotubes:** Rolled-up sheets of graphene.

## Applications
-   **Medicine:** Nanoparticles that carry chemo drugs directly into a tumor, sparing the healthy cells.
-   **Water Filtration:** Nano-filters that can remove viruses and salt from water.

## Criticism / Limitations
-   **Toxicity:** We don't fully know if nanoparticles are safe. Because they are so small, they can cross the blood-brain barrier. Are we breathing them in?
