## Overview
Normal chemistry is about electrons (the outer shell). The nucleus (the center) stays boring and stable. Nuclear Chemistry is what happens when the nucleus gets excited. It splits, fuses, and shoots out rays. It is the chemistry of the stars and the atomic bomb.

## Core Idea
The core idea is **Binding Energy**. The nucleus is held together by the Strong Nuclear Force (the strongest force in the universe). When you break that bond (Fission) or forge a new one (Fusion), you release a terrifying amount of energy ($E=mc^2$).

## Formal Definition
The study of the chemical and physical properties of elements as influenced by changes in the structure of the atomic nucleus.

## Intuition
-   **Chemical Reaction (Burning Coal):** Re-arranging the furniture in the house. (Releases some heat).
-   **Nuclear Reaction (Uranium):** Blowing up the foundation of the house. (Releases massive energy).

## Examples
-   **Carbon Dating:** Carbon-14 is radioactive. It decays at a steady rate (Half-life = 5,730 years). By measuring how much is left in a bone, we know when the animal died.
-   **The Sun:** A giant fusion reactor. It smashes Hydrogen atoms together to make Helium. The "waste" heat is sunlight.
-   **Chernobyl:** When a fission reactor goes wrong. The core melted, releasing radioactive isotopes (Iodine-131, Cesium-137) that poison the land for centuries.

## Common Misconceptions
-   **All radiation is bad:** We are bathed in background radiation every day (from bananas, the sun, granite rocks). Our bodies can handle small amounts.
-   **Nuclear power creates CO2:** No, it is carbon-free. The "smoke" from the cooling towers is just steam.

## Related Concepts
-   **Half-Life:** The time it takes for 50% of the sample to decay. It is a constant clock.
-   **Isotopes:** Atoms of the same element with different numbers of neutrons. (Uranium-235 explodes; Uranium-238 is stable).

## Applications
-   **Medicine:** PET Scans use radioactive sugar to find cancer (because cancer eats sugar fast). Radiation Therapy uses beams to burn tumors.
-   **Smoke Detectors:** Use a tiny piece of Americium-241 (radioactive) to detect smoke particles.

## Criticism / Limitations
-   **Waste:** We still don't know what to do with the radioactive waste from power plants. We just bury it and hope it stays safe for 10,000 years.
