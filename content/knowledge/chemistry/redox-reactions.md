  Redox (reduction–oxidation) reactions include all chemical reactions in which atoms have their oxidation state changed; in general, redox reactions involve the transfer of electrons between chemical species.

## Overview
Fire, rust, batteries, and breathing. What do they have in common? They are all Redox reactions. It is the chemistry of electron theft. One atom loses an electron (Oxidation), and another grabs it (Reduction). This flow of electrons is what powers life and technology.

## Core Idea
The core idea is **Electron Transfer**.
-   **OIL RIG:** **O**xidation **I**s **L**oss (of electrons). **R**eduction **I**s **G**ain (of electrons).
You can't have one without the other. If someone sells, someone must buy.

## Formal Definition
A type of chemical reaction that involves a transfer of electrons between two species.
-   **Oxidizing Agent:** The thief. It takes electrons (and gets reduced). Example: Oxygen.
-   **Reducing Agent:** The victim. It gives electrons (and gets oxidized). Example: Hydrogen.

## Intuition
-   **Rust:** Iron ($Fe$) meets Oxygen ($O_2$). Oxygen is a bully. It steals electrons from the Iron. The Iron turns into a crumbly red powder ($Fe_2O_3$).
-   **Battery:** We separate the thief and the victim with a wall. We force the electrons to travel through a wire to get from one to the other. That flow of electrons is electricity.

## Examples
-   **Respiration:** You eat sugar (Reducing Agent) and breathe oxygen (Oxidizing Agent). Your cells burn the sugar to make energy. You are a slow-burning fire.
-   **Photosynthesis:** The reverse. Plants use sunlight to force electrons back onto Carbon Dioxide to make sugar.
-   **Bleach:** A strong oxidizer. It steals electrons from the pigment molecules in your clothes, breaking their bonds so they can't reflect color anymore.

## Common Misconceptions
-   **Oxidation requires Oxygen:** Historically, yes. But chemically, Fluorine can oxidize things even better than Oxygen. "Oxidation" just means "losing electrons."
-   **Reduction means getting smaller:** No, it means the *charge* gets reduced (goes from +1 to 0).

## Related Concepts
-   **Electrochemistry:** Using redox to make electricity (Batteries) or using electricity to make chemicals (Electrolysis).
-   **Antioxidants:** Molecules (like Vitamin C) that sacrifice themselves. They give their electrons to "Free Radicals" (rogue oxidizers) so the radicals don't steal electrons from your DNA.

## Applications
-   **Fuel Cells:** Cars that run on Hydrogen. The only exhaust is water. It's a clean redox reaction.
-   **Galvanization:** Dipping steel in Zinc. The Zinc sacrifices itself (corrodes first) to protect the steel.

## Criticism / Limitations
-   **Corrosion:** The downside of living on an oxygen-rich planet. Everything metal eventually falls apart. We spend billions fighting rust.
