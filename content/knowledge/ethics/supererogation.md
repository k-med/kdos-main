## Overview
Supererogation refers to acts that are morally good but not (strictly) required. They go "above and beyond the call of duty."

## Core Idea
The core idea is that there is a difference between "duty" (what you must do) and "heroism" (what is awesome to do). Not everything good is mandatory.

## Formal Definition
An act is supererogatory if:
1.  It is morally good.
2.  It is not morally obligatory.
3.  Omission of it is not morally wrong.

## Intuition
-   **The Soldier:** A soldier who jumps on a grenade is a hero. If he *didn't* jump, we wouldn't put him in jail or call him "evil." He did more than was required.
-   **Charity:** Giving 10% of your income might be a duty. Giving 90% and living in a tent is supererogatory.

## Examples
-   **Saints and Heroes:** People who dedicate their entire lives to the poor (Mother Teresa) or risk their lives for others.
-   **Forgiveness:** Sometimes forgiving a terrible wrong is seen as supererogatory (you have a right to be angry, but you choose to forgive).

## Common Misconceptions
-   **Misconception:** Utilitarianism allows supererogation.
    -   **Correction:** Standard Utilitarianism says you must *always* maximize the good. If giving 90% does the most good, it is your *duty*, not supererogation. This makes the theory very demanding (it eliminates the category of "above and beyond").
-   **Misconception:** It's just "extra credit."
    -   **Correction:** It is vital for the flourishing of society, providing inspiration and extreme good.

## Related Concepts
-   **Duty:** The baseline of morality.
-   **Praiseworthiness:** We praise supererogatory acts more than duty (you don't get a medal for not killing people).
-   **The Demandingness Objection:** The criticism that theories (like Utilitarianism) that deny supererogation ask too much of humans.

## Applications
-   **Law:** The law enforces duties (don't steal), not supererogation (be generous).
-   **Religion:** Catholicism distinguishes between "precepts" (for everyone) and "counsels of perfection" (for those seeking holiness).

## Criticism and Limitations
-   **Where is the line?** It is hard to define exactly where duty ends and heroism begins. (Is saving a drowning child heroic or a duty?).
