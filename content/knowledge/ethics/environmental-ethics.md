# Environmental Ethics

## Overview
Environmental ethics is the discipline in philosophy that studies the moral relationship of human beings to, and also the value and moral status of, the environment and its non-human contents.

## Core Idea
The core idea is expanding the "moral circle" beyond just humans to include animals, plants, ecosystems, and the planet itself.

## Formal Definition
It challenges the traditional **anthropocentric** (human-centered) view of ethics and proposes **biocentric** (life-centered) or **ecocentric** (ecosystem-centered) views.

## Intuition
-   **The Last Man:** If the last person on Earth destroyed a beautiful forest before dying, did they do something wrong? An anthropocentrist might say "No, because no humans were harmed." An environmental ethicist says "Yes, the forest has intrinsic value."
-   **Stewardship:** We are not owners of the Earth, but caretakers.

## Examples
-   **Deep Ecology:** The view that all living things have equal right to live and blossom.
-   **Climate Change Ethics:** The moral obligation to future generations to preserve a habitable planet.
-   **Animal Rights:** (Often overlaps) The duty not to harm sentient beings.

## Common Misconceptions
-   **Misconception:** It's just about "hugging trees."
    -   **Correction:** It involves rigorous arguments about value theory, rights, and intergenerational justice.
-   **Misconception:** We must stop all development.
    -   **Correction:** Most argue for *sustainable* development, balancing human needs with environmental health.

## Related Concepts
-   **Anthropocentrism:** The view that only humans have intrinsic value.
-   **Intrinsic vs. Instrumental Value:** Is a tree valuable in itself (intrinsic) or only because it gives us wood/oxygen (instrumental)?
-   **Tragedy of the Commons:** The economic/ethical problem of shared resources being depleted.

## Applications
-   **Policy:** Carbon taxes, endangered species acts, and conservation laws.
-   **Corporate Responsibility:** ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) criteria for companies.

## Criticism and Limitations
-   **Eco-Fascism:** The fear that prioritizing the "ecosystem" could lead to sacrificing individual human rights (e.g., forced population control).
-   **Practicality:** It is hard to weigh the interests of a river against the interests of a human community needing a dam.
