# Divine Command Theory

## Overview
Divine Command Theory (DCT) is a meta-ethical theory which proposes that an action's status as morally good or bad is equivalent to whether it is commanded or forbidden by God.

## Core Idea
The core idea is that morality is ultimately based on the will of God. Without God, there would be no objective moral duties.

## Formal Definition
DCT holds that "X is obligatory" is identical in meaning or truth conditions to "God commands X."

## Intuition
-   **The Parent:** Just as a child must obey their parent because the parent is the authority, humans must obey God.
-   **The Source:** If God created the universe, He also created the rules for how to live in it.

## Examples
-   **The Ten Commandments:** "Thou shall not kill" is wrong *because* God said so.
-   **Abraham and Isaac:** In the Bible, God commands Abraham to sacrifice his son. Under DCT, this act would be morally right simply because God commanded it (even if it seems horrific to human reason).

## Common Misconceptions
-   **Misconception:** Atheists can't be moral.
    -   **Correction:** DCT says atheists can act morally (by coincidence or conscience), but they cannot *explain* the objective basis of that morality without God.
-   **Misconception:** God's commands are arbitrary.
    -   **Correction:** Many defenders say God commands things *because* of His perfectly good nature, so He wouldn't command cruelty.

## Related Concepts
-   **Euthyphro Dilemma:** (See below).
-   **Natural Law:** The view that God's law is written into the fabric of nature and reason, not just arbitrary commands.
-   **Theonomy:** The idea that society should be governed by divine law.

## Applications
-   **Religious Ethics:** The foundation for Jewish, Christian, and Islamic ethics.
-   **conscientious Objection:** Refusing to follow human laws that conflict with divine commands.

## Criticism and Limitations
-   **The Euthyphro Dilemma:** Socrates asked: "Is the pious loved by the gods because it is pious, or is it pious because it is loved by the gods?"
    -   If the former: Morality exists independently of God (God just recognizes it).
    -   If the latter: Morality is arbitrary (God could command murder, and it would be "good").
-   **Pluralism:** Which God? Which commands? Different religions disagree.
