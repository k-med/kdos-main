# Business Ethics

## Overview
Business ethics (also corporate ethics) is a form of applied ethics or professional ethics that examines ethical principles and moral or ethical problems that arise in a business environment.

## Core Idea
The core idea is that businesses are not just profit machines operating in a moral vacuum; they are social entities with responsibilities to various stakeholders (employees, customers, community), not just shareholders.

## Formal Definition
Business ethics applies ethical theories (like utilitarianism, deontology, virtue ethics) to business practices, policies, and institutions.

## Intuition
-   **The Lemon Car:** A dealer knows a car has a hidden defect. Selling it might be profitable (good for business?), but it is dishonest and dangerous (bad ethics). Business ethics argues that good business must also be ethical.
-   **Fair Pay:** Paying workers a living wage might cost more, but it respects their dignity and rights.

## Examples
-   **Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR):** Companies voluntarily taking steps to improve society (e.g., reducing carbon footprint, charitable giving).
-   **Whistleblowing:** An employee exposing illegal or unethical behavior within their company (often at great personal risk).
-   **Insider Trading:** Trading stock based on non-public information is unethical because it rigs the market.

## Common Misconceptions
-   **Misconception:** Business ethics is an oxymoron.
    -   **Correction:** While profit is a goal, long-term success usually requires trust and reputation, which depend on ethics.
-   **Misconception:** It's just about following the law.
    -   **Correction:** Ethics often requires more than the law (e.g., not exploiting a legal loophole to harm people).

## Related Concepts
-   **Stakeholder Theory:** The view that a company should create value for all stakeholders, not just shareholders.
-   **Shareholder Primacy:** The opposing view (Friedman) that the only social responsibility of business is to increase its profits.
-   **Triple Bottom Line:** Measuring success by People, Planet, and Profit.

## Applications
-   **Marketing:** Truth in advertising vs. manipulation.
-   **Supply Chain:** Ensuring products are not made with child labor or slave labor.

## Criticism and Limitations
-   **Greenwashing:** Companies pretending to be ethical/green just for PR, without real change.
-   **Profit Conflict:** When ethics and profit genuinely conflict, profit often wins, leading critics to say voluntary ethics is insufficient (regulation is needed).
