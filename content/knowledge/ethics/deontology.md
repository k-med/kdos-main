  Deontology is the normative ethical theory that the morality of an action should be based on whether that action itself is right or wrong under a series of rules, rather than based on the consequences of the action.

## Overview
"Do the right thing, even if the heavens fall." Deontology is about duty, rules, and rights. It's the opposite of Utilitarianism.

## Core Idea
**Categorical Imperative:** Act only according to that maxim whereby you can, at the same time, will that it should become a universal law. (Immanuel Kant).
Translation: Don't make exceptions for yourself. If you lie, you are saying "It's okay for everyone to lie," which would destroy trust.

## Formal Definition (if applicable)
**Formula of Humanity:** Act in such a way that you treat humanity, whether in your own person or in the person of any other, never merely as a means to an end, but always at the same time as an end. (Don't use people).

## Intuition
Batman refuses to kill the Joker, even though the Joker will escape and kill again. Batman is a deontologist. He has a rule ("No killing") and he sticks to it, regardless of the consequences.

## Examples
- **Human Rights:** You have a right to free speech, even if your speech makes people unhappy.
- **Ten Commandments:** "Thou shalt not steal" (Period. Not "Thou shalt not steal unless you really need it").
- **Professional Codes:** Doctors have a duty of confidentiality.

## Common Misconceptions
- "It's just following orders." (Kant believed you must use your own reason to discover the moral law, not just obey authority.)
- "It's rigid." (It can be, but modern deontologists allow for conflicting duties.)

## Related Concepts
- **Divine Command Theory:** Things are right because God commands them.
- **Prima Facie Duties:** Duties that can be overridden by more important duties (W.D. Ross).
- **Rights-Based Ethics:** Focusing on what people are owed.

## Applications
- **Law:** The justice system protects rights even if it's inefficient.
- **Medicine:** Informed consent (you can't experiment on a patient without permission, even if it cures cancer).
- **War:** The Geneva Conventions (rules of war).

## Criticism / Limitations
"Dirty Hands": Sometimes you have to do something wrong to prevent a catastrophe (e.g., lying to the Nazis to hide Jews). Kant said lying is always wrong, which seems absurd in that case.
