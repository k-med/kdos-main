## Overview
Consequentialism is a class of normative ethical theories holding that the consequences of one's conduct are the ultimate basis for any judgment about the rightness or wrongness of that conduct.

## Core Idea
The core idea is "the ends justify the means." An action is right if it produces the best overall outcome.

## Formal Definition
Consequentialism is the view that normative properties depend only on consequences. The most famous form is Utilitarianism, which holds that the best consequence is the one that maximizes utility (usually defined as happiness or well-being).

## Intuition
-   **The Trolley Problem:** A trolley is heading towards five people. You can pull a lever to switch it to a track with one person. A consequentialist typically pulls the lever because saving five lives is a better outcome than saving one (5 > 1).
-   **Charity:** You donate to the charity that saves the most lives per dollar, regardless of whether it's local or foreign, because the outcome is what matters.

## Examples
-   **Utilitarianism:** (Jeremy Bentham, John Stuart Mill) - Act to maximize the greatest happiness for the greatest number.
-   **Rule Consequentialism:** Follow the *rules* that, if generally followed, would produce the best consequences.
-   **Effective Altruism:** A modern movement applying consequentialist reasoning to charitable giving and career choice.

## Common Misconceptions
-   **Misconception:** It means you can do anything evil (like murder) if it leads to a good result.
    -   **Correction:** While theoretically possible (e.g., killing a tyrant), most consequentialists argue that such actions usually have bad long-term consequences (eroding trust, rule of law), so they are rarely actually justified.
-   **Misconception:** It is just "selfishness."
    -   **Correction:** Most forms (like Utilitarianism) are impartial; your own happiness counts for no more than anyone else's.

## Related Concepts
-   **Deontology:** The opposing view that duties and rules define right action, regardless of consequences.
-   **Virtue Ethics:** Focuses on character rather than acts or consequences.
-   **Utility:** The measure of "good" to be maximized (pleasure, preference satisfaction, etc.).

## Applications
-   **Public Policy:** Cost-benefit analysis is a consequentialist tool used by governments to decide on regulations.
-   **Triage:** In medical emergencies, treating those who are most likely to survive and benefit is a consequentialist approach.

## Criticism and Limitations
-   **Demandingness:** It might require you to give away all your money until you are as poor as the people you are helping.
-   **Rights Violations:** It could justify sacrificing an innocent person to save others (e.g., harvesting organs from one healthy person to save five).
-   **Prediction:** It is hard to know the long-term consequences of our actions.
