## Overview
Evolutionary ethics is a field that explores how evolutionary theory can bear on our understanding of ethics and morality. It asks: Did morality evolve? And if so, does that debunk it?

## Core Idea
The core idea is that our moral instincts (empathy, fairness, shame) are adaptations that helped our ancestors survive and reproduce in social groups.

## Formal Definition
-   **Descriptive Evolutionary Ethics:** Explaining *why* we have the moral beliefs we do (biology/psychology).
-   **Normative Evolutionary Ethics:** Trying to derive *what we ought to do* from evolution (often criticized).

## Intuition
-   **The Selfish Gene:** Why do we care for our children? Because they carry our genes. Why do we help friends? Reciprocal altruism ("I scratch your back, you scratch mine").
-   **The Trolley Problem:** Our intuition to not push the fat man might be an evolved aversion to physical violence, whereas pulling the lever feels different because it's abstract.

## Examples
-   **Incest Taboo:** Most cultures ban incest. Evolution explains this as a mechanism to avoid genetic defects (Westermarck effect).
-   **Group Selection:** Groups with more altruists outcompeted groups of selfish individuals.

## Common Misconceptions
-   **Misconception:** Evolution makes "might makes right" correct.
    -   **Correction:** That is the Naturalistic Fallacy. Just because nature is cruel doesn't mean we *should* be.
-   **Misconception:** It proves morality is fake.
    -   **Correction:** It explains the *origin* of morality, but that doesn't necessarily mean moral truths don't exist (Genetic Fallacy).

## Related Concepts
-   **Social Darwinism:** A discredited ideology applying "survival of the fittest" to human society.
-   **Naturalistic Fallacy:** Deriving an "ought" from an "is."
-   **Debunking Arguments:** Arguments that if morality is just an evolutionary tool, objective moral truth is unlikely.

## Applications
-   **Psychology:** Understanding moral intuitions.
-   **Animal Ethics:** Recognizing the roots of morality in other primates (Frans de Waal).

## Criticism and Limitations
-   **The Is-Ought Gap:** Evolution tells us what *is* (we are tribal), not what *ought* to be (we should be cosmopolitan).
-   **Reductionism:** Can complex things like "justice" really be reduced to "survival strategies"?
