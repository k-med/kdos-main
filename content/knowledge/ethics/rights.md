## Overview
Rights are legal, social, or ethical principles of freedom or entitlement. They are the fundamental normative rules about what is allowed of people or owed to people.

## Core Idea
The core idea is that individuals have a "protective sphere" around them that others (including the government) cannot cross. Rights are "trumps" (Dworkin) that override utility.

## Formal Definition
-   **Negative Rights:** The right to be left alone (e.g., Free Speech, Freedom of Religion). The duty is on others to *not interfere*.
-   **Positive Rights:** The right to be provided with something (e.g., Right to Healthcare, Education). The duty is on others (usually the state) to *provide*.

## Intuition
-   **The Riot:** A mob wants to kill an innocent man to prevent a riot that would kill ten people. A utilitarian might say "kill him." A rights theorist says "No, he has a right to life. You cannot violate it, even for the greater good."

## Examples
-   **Natural Rights:** Rights you have just by being human (Locke: Life, Liberty, Property).
-   **Legal Rights:** Rights given by law (e.g., the right to drive).
-   **Human Rights:** The modern international consensus (UN Declaration).

## Common Misconceptions
-   **Misconception:** Rights are absolute.
    -   **Correction:** Most rights have limits (e.g., you can't yell "Fire!" in a crowded theater). Rights can conflict.
-   **Misconception:** Only humans have rights.
    -   **Correction:** (See Animal Rights). Corporations also have legal rights.

## Related Concepts
-   **Duties:** Rights and duties are correlative. If I have a right to life, you have a duty not to kill me.
-   **Libertarianism:** A political philosophy emphasizing negative rights.
-   **Social Democracy:** Emphasizes positive rights.

## Applications
-   **Constitution:** The Bill of Rights.
-   **International Law:** The Universal Declaration of Human Rights (1948).

## Criticism and Limitations
-   **Rights Inflation:** If everything becomes a "right" (right to internet, right to vacation), the concept loses its power.
-   **Nonsense on Stilts:** Jeremy Bentham called natural rights "nonsense on stilts" because he believed only legal rights existed.
