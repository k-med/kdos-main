## Overview
"No justice, no peace." But what is justice? Is it equality? Freedom? Getting what you deserve?

## Core Idea
**Justice as Fairness (Rawls):** Imagine you are designing a society but you don't know who you will be in it (rich/poor, smart/dumb, healthy/sick). This is the **Veil of Ignorance**. You would choose a society where the worst-off person is as well-off as possible (Maximin).

## Formal Definition (if applicable)
**Distributive Justice:** How resources (wealth, opportunity) are shared.
**Retributive Justice:** How punishment is meted out.
**Restorative Justice:** Repairing the harm caused by crime.

## Intuition
- **Libertarianism (Nozick):** Justice is liberty. If I make money fairly, it's mine. Taxing me to help the poor is theft (forced labor).
- **Utilitarianism:** Justice is maximizing happiness. If taking \$1 from a billionaire gives \$100 of happiness to a starving person, do it.

## Examples
- **Affirmative Action:** Is it just to treat people differently to correct past injustice?
- **Universal Basic Income:** Does everyone deserve a living wage?
- **Capital Punishment:** Is it ever just to kill a criminal?

## Common Misconceptions
- "Fair means equal." (Not always. Is it fair to give a wheelchair to someone who can walk? No. Equity vs. Equality.)
- "The law is justice." (Laws can be unjust. Apartheid was legal.)

## Related Concepts
- **Social Contract:** The agreement between citizens and the state.
- **Meritocracy:** The idea that power/wealth should go to the most able.
- **Human Rights:** Universal entitlements.

## Applications
- **Tax Policy:** Progressive taxation.
- **Criminal Justice Reform:** Ending mass incarceration.
- **Global Justice:** What do rich nations owe poor nations?

## Criticism / Limitations
Rawls assumes we are risk-averse. Maybe we would gamble on being rich?
