## Overview
Theory is nice, but what do we *do*? Applied ethics takes the tools of philosophy (Utilitarianism, Deontology) and uses them to solve real problems like climate change, abortion, and war.

## Core Idea
**Reflective Equilibrium:** Going back and forth between our principles and our intuitions about specific cases until they match.

## Formal Definition (if applicable)
**Just War Theory:** A set of criteria for when war is morally justifiable (Jus ad bellum) and how it must be fought (Jus in bello).

## Intuition
- **Business Ethics:** Is it okay to bluff in negotiations? Is profit the only goal?
- **Environmental Ethics:** Do we have duties to future generations? To trees?
- **Animal Ethics:** Is eating meat wrong?

## Examples
- **The Trolley Problem:** A classic thought experiment used to test intuitions.
- **Whistleblowing:** When is it right to betray your employer to protect the public?
- **Affirmative Action:** Is reverse discrimination justified to correct past wrongs?

## Common Misconceptions
- "It's just opinion." (Applied ethics uses rigorous logic and evidence.)
- "Legal = Moral." (Slavery was legal. The Holocaust was legal. Ethics judges the law.)

## Related Concepts
- **Professional Ethics:** Codes of conduct for lawyers, engineers, journalists.
- **Casuistry:** Reasoning from case to case (precedent).
- **Moral Status:** Who counts? (Humans? Animals? AI?).

## Applications
- **Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR):** Companies trying to do good.
- **Policy Making:** Drafting laws on self-driving cars.
- **Daily Life:** Being a vegetarian, recycling, donating to charity.

## Criticism / Limitations
Experts often disagree. There is rarely a single "right answer," but there are better and worse arguments.
