# Forgiveness

## Overview
Forgiveness is the intentional and voluntary process by which a victim undergoes a change in feelings and attitude regarding an offense, letting go of negative emotions such as resentment and vengeance.

## Core Idea
The core idea is releasing the debt. The wrongdoer owes you something (an apology, a debt), and you choose to cancel that debt, not because they necessarily deserve it, but for the sake of relationship or your own peace.

## Formal Definition
Forgiveness is the overcoming of resentment (Butler). It is distinct from:
-   **Pardoning:** A legal act (remitting punishment).
-   **Condoning:** Accepting the wrong as okay.
-   **Forgetting:** Losing the memory of the wrong.

## Intuition
-   **The Grudge:** Holding a grudge is like drinking poison and expecting the other person to die. Forgiveness is putting the poison down.
-   **The Prodigal Son:** The father forgives the son who wasted his inheritance, celebrating his return rather than punishing him.

## Examples
-   **Restorative Justice:** Truth and Reconciliation Commissions (e.g., South Africa) focused on forgiveness and truth-telling rather than just punishment.
-   **Self-Forgiveness:** Letting go of guilt for one's own mistakes.

## Common Misconceptions
-   **Misconception:** You must forgive to be a good person.
    -   **Correction:** Some argue that "unforgivable" acts exist and that resentment can be a sign of self-respect.
-   **Misconception:** Forgiveness means reconciliation.
    -   **Correction:** You can forgive an abuser (let go of anger) without ever seeing them again (reconciling).

## Related Concepts
-   **Resentment:** The moral anger felt when one is wronged.
-   **Mercy:** Treating someone better than they deserve (often by a superior/judge).
-   **Apology:** The act of acknowledging wrong, often a precondition for forgiveness.

## Applications
-   **Therapy:** Forgiveness is often a goal in therapy to heal trauma.
-   **Politics:** Can nations forgive each other for past wars?

## Criticism and Limitations
-   **Cheap Grace:** Forgiving too easily can enable the abuser to continue harming.
-   **The Paradox of Forgiveness:** If the person has repented, they *deserve* to be treated well, so it's not forgiveness. If they haven't repented, forgiveness seems condoning. So when is forgiveness possible?
