# Care Ethics

## Overview
Care ethics (or the ethics of care) is a normative ethical theory that holds that moral action centers on interpersonal relationships and care or benevolence as a virtue. It developed as a feminist critique of traditional ethical theories like deontology and utilitarianism.

## Core Idea
The core idea is that morality is not about abstract rules or calculations, but about responding to the needs of specific others with whom we have relationships.

## Formal Definition
Care ethics emphasizes the importance of responsiveness to the needs of others (care) that leads to a focus on relationships and context rather than abstract principles.

## Intuition
-   **The Mother and Child:** A mother doesn't care for her child because of a "duty" or a "utility calculation." She does it out of love and connection. Care ethics says this is a paradigm of moral behavior, not an exception.
-   **The Friend:** If you visit a friend in the hospital "because it's my duty," they might feel hurt. If you visit because you *care*, that is morally superior.

## Examples
-   **Carol Gilligan's "In a Different Voice":** Gilligan argued that women often reason morally through a "voice of care" (relationships, responsibilities) rather than a "voice of justice" (rights, rules), and that this had been unfairly devalued by psychologists like Kohlberg.
-   **Nursing:** The profession of nursing is often cited as an embodiment of care ethics.

## Common Misconceptions
-   **Misconception:** It is just "being nice" or emotional.
    -   **Correction:** It involves complex reasoning about needs, context, and conflicting responsibilities.
-   **Misconception:** It is only for the private sphere (home/family).
    -   **Correction:** Many theorists apply it to politics and international relations (e.g., care for refugees).

## Related Concepts
-   **Feminist Ethics:** Care ethics is a major branch of feminist ethics.
-   **Virtue Ethics:** Care can be seen as a virtue, linking the two traditions.
-   **Partiality:** Unlike utilitarianism (which is impartial), care ethics embraces partiality toward loved ones.

## Applications
-   **Healthcare:** shifting focus from "patient rights" to "patient care" and the doctor-patient relationship.
-   **Education:** Emphasizing the teacher-student relationship as central to learning.

## Criticism and Limitations
-   **Parochialism:** If we only care for those near us, we might ignore global injustice.
-   **Essentialism:** Does it reinforce the stereotype of women as "natural caregivers"?
-   **Exploitation:** Emphasizing self-sacrifice for others can lead to the exploitation of caregivers (who are often women).
