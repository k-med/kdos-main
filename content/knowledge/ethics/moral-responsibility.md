# Moral Responsibility

## Overview
Moral responsibility refers to the status of morally deserving praise, blame, reward, or punishment for an act or omission performed in accordance with one's moral obligations.

## Core Idea
The core idea is accountability. You are the author of your actions, and you must answer for them.

## Formal Definition
To be morally responsible, an agent usually needs:
1.  **Control Condition:** The action was up to them (Free Will).
2.  **Epistemic Condition:** They knew (or should have known) what they were doing.

## Intuition
-   **The Sleepwalker:** If you kill someone while sleepwalking, you are not morally responsible because you weren't in control.
-   **The Child:** A toddler who breaks a vase isn't "blamed" like an adult would be, because they don't understand.

## Examples
-   **Determinism:** If the universe is fully determined by physics, and my brain is just atoms obeying physics, do I have free will? If not, can I be responsible? (The Hard Determinist says no).
-   **Compatibilism:** The view that free will and determinism are compatible. As long as I act according to my desires (even if determined), I am responsible.

## Common Misconceptions
-   **Misconception:** Responsibility = Causality.
    -   **Correction:** A storm causes damage, but isn't responsible. Responsibility requires agency.
-   **Misconception:** You are only responsible for what you intend.
    -   **Correction:** You can be responsible for negligence (what you *failed* to do or notice).

## Related Concepts
-   **Free Will:** The ability to choose between different possible courses of action.
-   **Excusing Conditions:** Ignorance, coercion, insanity.
-   **Collective Responsibility:** Can a whole nation be responsible for a war?

## Applications
-   **Criminal Law:** The insanity defense relies on the lack of moral responsibility (mens rea).
-   **AI:** Who is responsible when a self-driving car crashes? The coder? The owner? The car?

## Criticism and Limitations
-   **The Luck Objection:** (See Moral Luck). If so much is luck, responsibility seems to shrink.
-   **Neuroscience:** Experiments (Libet) suggesting our brains decide before we are conscious of the choice challenge the basis of responsibility.
