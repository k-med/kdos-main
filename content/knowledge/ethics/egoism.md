# Egoism

## Overview
Egoism is an ethical theory that treats self-interest as the foundation of morality. It comes in two main forms: Psychological Egoism (we *always* act in self-interest) and Ethical Egoism (we *ought* to act in self-interest).

## Core Idea
The core idea is that looking out for number one is the rational or moral thing to do. Altruism (sacrificing for others) is either impossible or immoral.

## Formal Definition
-   **Psychological Egoism:** The descriptive view that humans are always motivated by self-interest, even in acts of seeming charity (e.g., doing it for the warm glow).
-   **Ethical Egoism:** The normative view that moral agents ought to do what is in their own self-interest.

## Intuition
-   **The Oxygen Mask:** "Put on your own mask before helping others." You can't help anyone if you are dead. Egoism extends this logic to all of life.
-   **Capitalism:** The idea that if everyone pursues their own profit, the "invisible hand" will benefit society.

## Examples
-   **Ayn Rand:** A famous proponent of "Rational Egoism." She argued that selfishness is a virtue and altruism is a vice that destroys the individual.
-   **Hobbes:** Argued that self-interest is the fundamental human motivation, necessitating a strong government to prevent a "war of all against all."

## Common Misconceptions
-   **Misconception:** Egoism means being a jerk/hedonist.
    -   **Correction:** "Rational" egoism might mean cooperating with others, building a reputation, and being kind, because those things ultimately benefit *you* in the long run.
-   **Misconception:** Psychological egoism is scientifically proven.
    -   **Correction:** It is unfalsifiable (you can always invent a hidden selfish motive) and contradicted by evolutionary biology (kin selection).

## Related Concepts
-   **Altruism:** The opposite of egoism—acting for the sake of others.
-   **Hedonism:** The pursuit of pleasure (often linked with egoism).
-   **Social Contract:** We agree to rules for mutual benefit (a sophisticated egoist strategy).

## Applications
-   **Economics:** Standard economic models assume agents are rational egoists (Homo Economicus).
-   **Business:** The debate over whether a corporation's only duty is to its shareholders (Friedman doctrine).

## Criticism and Limitations
-   **The Arbitrariness Problem:** Why is *my* self-interest special? It seems arbitrary to say "I matter, but you don't."
-   **Conflict Resolution:** If we both want the same resource, egoism gives us no way to resolve the conflict other than fighting.
-   **Intuition:** It clashes with our deep moral intuition that helping others is good.
