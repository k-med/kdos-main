# Consent

## Overview
Consent is a fundamental concept in ethics, law, and social philosophy. It is the agreement or permission given by a person to allow something to happen or to do something. It transforms what would otherwise be a violation (like assault or theft) into a permissible act (like surgery or a gift).

## Core Idea
The core idea is autonomy. Because you own your body and property, others need your permission to touch or use them.

## Formal Definition
Valid consent typically requires three conditions:
1.  **Voluntary:** Given freely without coercion.
2.  **Informed:** The person understands what they are agreeing to.
3.  **Competent:** The person has the capacity to make the decision (e.g., not a child or intoxicated).

## Intuition
-   **Surgery:** If a doctor cuts you open without consent, it's battery. If you sign a form, it's life-saving surgery. The physical act is the same; consent changes the moral reality.
-   **Borrowing:** Taking a car without asking is theft. Taking it with asking is borrowing.

## Examples
-   **Sexual Consent:** "No means no" (and "Yes means yes"). The shift to affirmative consent models (enthusiastic agreement).
-   **Medical Consent:** Informed consent is the cornerstone of medical ethics.
-   **Political Consent:** (See Social Contract). The idea that government legitimacy comes from the "consent of the governed."

## Common Misconceptions
-   **Misconception:** Silence is consent.
    -   **Correction:** Consent must be communicated. Silence can mean fear, confusion, or unconsciousness.
-   **Misconception:** Once given, it cannot be withdrawn.
    -   **Correction:** You can revoke consent at any time.

## Related Concepts
-   **Paternalism:** Overriding someone's consent "for their own good" (usually considered unethical unless they are incompetent).
-   **Coercion:** Using force or threats to invalidate consent.
-   **Implied Consent:** Consent assumed from actions (e.g., holding out your arm for a blood test).

## Applications
-   **Data Privacy:** Clicking "I Agree" to Terms of Service (is this real consent if no one reads it?).
-   **Research:** Participants in studies must consent.

## Criticism and Limitations
-   **The Illusion of Choice:** If you have no other option (e.g., "sign this contract or starve"), is the consent truly voluntary?
-   **Manufacturing Consent:** How media and propaganda can manipulate people into consenting to things against their interests (Chomsky).
