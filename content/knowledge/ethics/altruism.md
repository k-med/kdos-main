## Overview
Altruism is the principle and moral practice of concern for the happiness of other human beings or other animals, resulting in a quality of life both material and spiritual.

## Core Idea
The core idea is selflessness. Acting for the benefit of others, even at a cost to oneself.

## Formal Definition
-   **Psychological Altruism:** The motivation to increase another's welfare as an end in itself.
-   **Biological Altruism:** Behavior that increases the fitness of another individual while decreasing the fitness of the actor.

## Intuition
-   **The Soldier:** Jumping on a grenade to save comrades.
-   **The Donor:** Giving a kidney to a stranger.
-   **Everyday Kindness:** Holding the door, tipping, helping a lost tourist.

## Examples
-   **Effective Altruism:** (See Consequentialism). Using evidence to do the *most* good possible.
-   **Kin Selection:** In biology, animals help their relatives because they share genes (explaining "altruism" via selfish genes).

## Common Misconceptions
-   **Misconception:** True altruism doesn't exist (Psychological Egoism).
    -   **Correction:** (See Egoism). Most philosophers and psychologists agree that genuine concern for others is possible.
-   **Misconception:** Altruism means being a doormat.
    -   **Correction:** You can care for others while also caring for yourself (self-care is not necessarily selfish).

## Related Concepts
-   **Egoism:** The opposite.
-   **Supererogation:** Acts that are good to do but not required (heroic altruism).
-   **Empathy:** The emotional capacity that often drives altruism.

## Applications
-   **Charity:** The entire non-profit sector relies on altruism.
-   **Blood Donation:** A classic example of institutionalized altruism.

## Criticism and Limitations
-   **Pathological Altruism:** Helping that hurts (e.g., enabling an addict, or "white knight" complexes).
-   **Rand's Critique:** Ayn Rand argued altruism is a morality of death because it demands you sacrifice your own life/values.
