## Overview
Ethics asks what we *should* do. Moral psychology asks why we *actually* do what we do. It studies the brain, emotions, and evolution of morality.

## Core Idea
**Moral Intuitionism (Haidt):** The elephant and the rider. Our moral judgments are mostly driven by quick, emotional intuitions (the elephant). Reasoning (the rider) comes later to justify what the elephant already decided.

## Formal Definition (if applicable)
**Moral Foundations Theory:** Morality is built on 6 foundations: Care/Harm, Fairness/Cheating, Loyalty/Betrayal, Authority/Subversion, Sanctity/Degradation, and Liberty/Oppression. Liberals focus on Care and Fairness; Conservatives value all 6.

## Intuition
Why does incest feel wrong even if they use protection and no one gets hurt? (Moral Dumbfounding). Your gut says "Yuck," and your brain struggles to find a reason.

## Examples
- **Trolley Problem Studies:** Most people will pull a lever to save 5, but won't push a fat man to save 5. Why? (Pushing feels more personal/violent).
- **Psychopathy:** People who lack empathy and guilt. They know the rules but don't *feel* them.
- **Altruism:** Why do we help strangers? (Evolutionary puzzle).

## Common Misconceptions
- "Morality is purely rational." (It's heavily emotional.)
- "We are born blank slates." (Babies show preferences for helpful puppets over mean ones.)

## Related Concepts
- **Kohlberg's Stages:** A theory of how moral reasoning develops in children.
- **Empathy:** The ability to feel what others feel.
- **Situationism:** Context affects behavior more than character (e.g., finding a dime makes you more likely to help someone).

## Applications
- **Politics:** Understanding why the other side thinks you are evil.
- **Education:** Teaching empathy.
- **Law:** Understanding criminal responsibility.

## Criticism / Limitations
Just because something is "natural" (evolutionary) doesn't mean it's "good" (Naturalistic Fallacy).
