## Overview
Moral realism is the meta-ethical view that there are objective moral facts or truths in the world, independent of human opinion or culture.

## Core Idea
The core idea is that "Murder is wrong" is a fact about the universe, just like "The earth is round." It isn't just a feeling or a social rule; it's a truth to be discovered.

## Formal Definition
Moral realism typically holds two theses:
1.  **Cognitivism:** Moral statements express propositions that are capable of being true or false.
2.  **Independence:** At least some of these propositions are true, and their truth does not depend on the subjective mental states of the observer.

## Intuition
-   **The Alien:** If aliens came to Earth and said "Torturing babies for fun is good," a moral realist would say "They are wrong," just as if they said "2+2=5." A non-realist might say "That's just their culture."
-   **Moral Progress:** We believe we are *better* than our ancestors who owned slaves. This implies there is a real standard we are getting closer to.

## Examples
-   **Naturalism:** Moral facts are natural facts (e.g., "good" = "promotes survival" or "maximizes happiness").
-   **Non-Naturalism:** Moral facts are a special kind of non-physical fact (like mathematical truths) known by intuition (G.E. Moore).

## Common Misconceptions
-   **Misconception:** Realism means being dogmatic.
    -   **Correction:** You can believe the truth exists but admit you might be wrong about what it is (Fallibilist Realism).
-   **Misconception:** It requires God.
    -   **Correction:** Many atheists are moral realists (e.g., secular humanists, utilitarians).

## Related Concepts
-   **Moral Anti-Realism:** The view that there are no objective moral facts (includes Relativism, Nihilism, Emotivism).
-   **Error Theory:** The view (J.L. Mackie) that moral statements try to state facts but always fail because moral facts don't exist (like talking about unicorns).
-   **Objectivity:** Realism is the strongest form of moral objectivity.

## Applications
-   **Human Rights:** The concept of universal human rights is usually grounded in some form of moral realism.
-   **Law:** Natural Law theory assumes there is a "higher law" that human laws must conform to.

## Criticism and Limitations
-   **The Argument from Queerness:** Mackie argued that objective moral values would be "queer" (strange) entities unlike anything else in the universe. How do we detect them?
-   **Disagreement:** If moral facts are real, why is there so much disagreement about them compared to scientific facts?
