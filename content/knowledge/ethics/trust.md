## Overview
Trust is a reliance on the integrity, strength, ability, or surety of a person or thing. In ethics, it is the glue that holds society together.

## Core Idea
The core idea is vulnerability. To trust is to make yourself vulnerable to another, believing they will not exploit that vulnerability.

## Formal Definition
Trust is an attitude that we have towards people whom we hope will be trustworthy, where trustworthiness is a property of being reliable and having good will.

## Intuition
-   **The Babysitter:** You leave your child with a stranger. You are trusting them with your most precious "possession."
-   **Money:** You put money in a bank. You trust the bank won't steal it and the government ensures the currency has value.

## Examples
-   **Interpersonal Trust:** Between friends and spouses.
-   **Institutional Trust:** Trust in the government, science, or the media. (Currently in decline).
-   **The Prisoner's Dilemma:** Shows that without trust, rational agents produce worse outcomes for everyone.

## Common Misconceptions
-   **Misconception:** Trust is blind.
    -   **Correction:** "Rational trust" is based on evidence of reliability. "Blind trust" is often foolish.
-   **Misconception:** Trust is just prediction.
    -   **Correction:** It involves a normative expectation. If I trust you and you fail, I don't just say "I predicted wrong"; I feel *betrayed*.

## Related Concepts
-   **Betrayal:** The violation of trust.
-   **Social Capital:** The collective value of all social networks and the inclinations that arise from these networks to do things for each other (trust).
-   **Distrust:** The active belief that someone is untrustworthy.

## Applications
-   **Business:** "Trust is the speed of business." Low trust means high transaction costs (lawyers, contracts).
-   **Politics:** Democracy requires trusting that the loser will accept the election results.

## Criticism and Limitations
-   **Risk:** Trust is risky. The "gullible" are often exploited.
-   **Exclusion:** High-trust groups (like mafias or cliques) can be very trusting internally but hostile to outsiders.
