## Overview
Euthanasia (from Greek "good death") is the practice of intentionally ending a life to relieve pain and suffering. It is a central topic in bioethics, raising questions about autonomy, the value of life, and the role of medicine.

## Core Idea
The core debate is between the sanctity of life (life is always good/sacred) and the quality of life (life is only good if it is bearable).

## Formal Definition
-   **Active Euthanasia:** Taking specific steps to cause death (e.g., injecting a lethal drug).
-   **Passive Euthanasia:** Withdrawing treatment to allow death to occur naturally (e.g., turning off a ventilator).
-   **Voluntary:** With the patient's consent.
-   **Non-voluntary:** When the patient cannot consent (e.g., coma).

## Intuition
-   **The Suffering Pet:** We put down pets to end their misery and call it an act of mercy. Proponents ask: Why do we deny this mercy to humans?
-   **The Slippery Slope:** Opponents worry that if we allow killing for mercy, we might eventually start killing the "unwanted" or "expensive" members of society.

## Examples
-   **Assisted Suicide:** A physician provides the means (pills), but the patient performs the act. Legal in some places (e.g., Switzerland, Oregon).
-   **Terminal Sedation:** Keeping a patient unconscious until they die (a common practice that blurs the line).

## Common Misconceptions
-   **Misconception:** It's always about physical pain.
    -   **Correction:** Often it is about loss of dignity, autonomy, or "existential suffering."
-   **Misconception:** Doctors oppose it.
    -   **Correction:** The medical community is deeply divided. Some see it as violating the Hippocratic Oath ("do no harm"); others see it as the ultimate harm reduction.

## Related Concepts
-   **Autonomy:** The right to control one's own body and death.
-   **Palliative Care:** Specialized medical care for people with serious illness (the alternative to euthanasia).
-   **Doctrine of Double Effect:** Doing something good (relieving pain) that has a bad side effect (hastening death) is permissible if the bad effect wasn't intended.

## Applications
-   **Law:** The legal status varies wildly around the world (e.g., legal in Benelux/Canada, illegal in most of US/UK).
-   **Advance Directives:** Living wills where people specify their wishes in case they become incapacitated.

## Criticism and Limitations
-   **Vulnerability:** Critics fear the elderly or disabled might feel pressured to "die" to stop being a burden.
-   **Sanctity of Life:** Religious arguments that life is a gift from God and we have no right to end it.
