## Overview
Can we clone humans? Should we edit babies' genes? Who gets the last ventilator? Bioethics deals with life and death questions in the age of high-tech medicine.

## Core Idea
**The Four Principles (Beauchamp & Childress):**
1.  **Autonomy:** Respecting the patient's right to choose.
2.  **Beneficence:** Acting in the patient's best interest.
3.  **Non-maleficence:** Do no harm.
4.  **Justice:** Fairness in distributing resources.

## Formal Definition (if applicable)
**Informed Consent:** The process by which a patient learns about and understands the purpose, benefits, and potential risks of a medical or surgical intervention, and then agrees to receive the treatment.

## Intuition
Medicine used to be "Paternalism" (Doctor knows best). Now it's a partnership. But technology moves faster than ethics. Just because we *can* keep a brain-dead body alive, *should* we?

## Examples
- **CRISPR:** Gene editing. Could cure diseases, but could leads to "designer babies."
- **Euthanasia:** The right to die with dignity vs. the sanctity of life.
- **Organ Transplants:** Selling kidneys? (Most say no, but the shortage is real).

## Common Misconceptions
- "It's just religious objections." (Secular bioethicists worry about inequality and safety too.)
- "Doctors decide." (Ethics committees include lawyers, philosophers, and community members.)

## Related Concepts
- **Personhood:** When does a fetus become a person? When does a comatose patient cease to be one?
- **Eugenics:** The dark history of trying to "improve" the human race.
- **Public Health Ethics:** Individual liberty vs. collective safety (e.g., vaccine mandates).

## Applications
- **Hospitals:** Ethics consults.
- **Research:** IRBs (Institutional Review Boards) approving experiments.
- **Law:** Roe v. Wade, end-of-life legislation.

## Criticism / Limitations
"Principlism" (the 4 principles) can be too abstract. How do you balance Autonomy vs. Beneficence when a patient refuses life-saving treatment?
