## Overview
Bioethics is the study of the ethical issues emerging from advances in biology and medicine. It is a multidisciplinary field combining philosophy, theology, law, and medicine.

## Core Idea
The core idea is that just because we *can* do something (technologically), doesn't mean we *should*. We need ethical guardrails for the power of modern science.

## Formal Definition
Bioethics typically relies on four key principles (Beauchamp and Childress):
1.  **Autonomy:** Respecting the patient's right to choose.
2.  **Beneficence:** Acting in the patient's best interest.
3.  **Non-maleficence:** "Do no harm."
4.  **Justice:** Fair distribution of resources.

## Intuition
-   **CRISPR:** We can now edit human genes. Should we eliminate genetic diseases? What about making "designer babies" with higher IQs? Bioethics asks where to draw the line.
-   **Organ Transplants:** Who gets the one available heart? The youngest? The sickest? The richest?

## Examples
-   **Cloning:** The ethical debate over cloning humans (identity, safety, playing God).
-   **End of Life:** Euthanasia, palliative care, and the definition of "brain death."
-   **Human Experimentation:** The history of abuses (like Tuskegee) led to strict bioethical codes for research.

## Common Misconceptions
-   **Misconception:** It's just for doctors.
    -   **Correction:** It affects everyone (patients, families, voters).
-   **Misconception:** It always says "no" to progress.
    -   **Correction:** It aims to guide progress responsibly, not stop it.

## Related Concepts
-   **Medical Ethics:** A subset focusing on clinical practice.
-   **Research Ethics:** Rules for conducting experiments.
-   **Transhumanism:** The movement to use technology to enhance human capabilities beyond biological limits.

## Applications
-   **Hospital Ethics Committees:** Groups that help resolve difficult cases in hospitals.
-   **Public Health:** Debates over vaccine mandates or lockdowns (individual liberty vs. public good).

## Criticism and Limitations
-   **Western Bias:** The four principles are often criticized as being too Western/individualistic.
-   **Vagueness:** Principles often conflict (Autonomy vs. Beneficence), and the theory doesn't always tell you which one wins.
