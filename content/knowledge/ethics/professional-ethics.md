## Overview
Professional ethics encompass the personal and corporate standards of behavior expected by professionals. It involves the ethical obligations that people have in virtue of their role as a professional (e.g., doctor, lawyer, engineer).

## Core Idea
The core idea is that professionals have special duties because society trusts them with critical goods (health, justice, safety).

## Formal Definition
Professional ethics are principles that govern the behavior of a person or group in a business environment. Like values, professional ethics provide rules on how a person should act towards other people and institutions in such an environment.

## Intuition
-   **The Lawyer:** A lawyer defends a client they know is guilty. Why? Because professional ethics (the duty of zealous representation) overrides their personal feeling that "bad guys should be punished."
-   **The Journalist:** A journalist protects a source's identity even if the police demand it.

## Examples
-   **Hippocratic Oath:** The foundational code for medical ethics ("First, do no harm").
-   **Attorney-Client Privilege:** The duty to keep client secrets.
-   **Engineering Ethics:** The duty to prioritize public safety over client profit (e.g., refusing to sign off on a dangerous bridge).

## Common Misconceptions
-   **Misconception:** It's just the same as ordinary morality.
    -   **Correction:** Sometimes it conflicts. A doctor might have to treat an enemy soldier. A lawyer might have to discredit a truthful witness.
-   **Misconception:** It's just about avoiding lawsuits.
    -   **Correction:** It is about maintaining the integrity of the profession.

## Related Concepts
-   **Fiduciary Duty:** The legal/ethical obligation to act in the best interest of another party (e.g., a financial advisor).
-   **Code of Conduct:** The written rules of a professional body.
-   **Conflict of Interest:** A situation where personal interests clash with professional duties.

## Applications
-   **Medicine:** Confidentiality, informed consent.
-   **Journalism:** Objectivity, protecting sources.
-   **Accounting:** Independence, accuracy (avoiding Enron-style fraud).

## Criticism and Limitations
-   **Protectionism:** Critics argue professional codes often serve to protect the profession's monopoly and income rather than the public.
-   **Role Morality:** Can you be a "good lawyer" but a "bad person"? (The problem of compartmentalization).
