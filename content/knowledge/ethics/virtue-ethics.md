# Virtue Ethics

## Overview
Virtue ethics is a broad term for theories that emphasize the role of character and virtue in moral philosophy rather than either doing one's duty (deontology) or acting in order to bring about good consequences (consequentialism).

## Core Idea
The core idea is "What kind of person should I be?" rather than "What should I do?" If you cultivate a virtuous character, right actions will follow naturally.

## Formal Definition
Virtue ethics focuses on the moral agent and their character. A right action is what a virtuous agent would characteristically do in the circumstances.

## Intuition
-   **The Honest Person:** An honest person tells the truth not because a rule says so, or because it pays off, but because *they are honest*. It is part of their identity.
-   **Eudaimonia:** The goal of life is "flourishing" or "happiness" (in a deep sense), achieved through virtue.

## Examples
-   **Aristotle:** The Golden Mean. Virtue is the mean between two vices (e.g., Courage is the mean between Cowardice and Rashness).
-   **Confucianism:** Focuses on the cultivation of *ren* (benevolence) and *li* (ritual propriety) to become a *junzi* (exemplary person).

## Common Misconceptions
-   **Misconception:** It has no rules.
    -   **Correction:** It has "v-rules" (e.g., "Do what is honest," "Do not be cruel"), but they are less rigid than deontological rules.
-   **Misconception:** It is self-centered.
    -   **Correction:** Virtues are often other-regarding (generosity, justice, friendship).

## Related Concepts
-   **Phronesis:** Practical wisdom—the ability to judge how to apply virtue in specific situations.
-   **Aretaic:** Relating to virtue (from the Greek *arete*).
-   **Character Education:** Teaching children habits of good character.

## Applications
-   **Medical Ethics:** The "good doctor" needs virtues like compassion and integrity, not just technical skill.
-   **Leadership:** We value leaders with "character."

## Criticism and Limitations
-   **Action-Guiding:** Critics say it doesn't tell us what to do in a dilemma. (e.g., "Be kind" and "Be honest" might conflict).
-   **Cultural Relativity:** Different cultures value different virtues (e.g., humility vs. pride).
