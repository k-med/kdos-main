## Overview
Utilitarianism focuses on consequences. Deontology focuses on rules. Virtue Ethics focuses on *you*. It's about building good character traits (virtues) so that doing the right thing becomes second nature.

## Core Idea
**Eudaimonia:** Often translated as "happiness," but it really means "flourishing" or "living well." It's the goal of human life. You achieve it by practicing the virtues.

## Formal Definition (if applicable)
**The Golden Mean:** Virtue is the mean between two extremes (vices).
- **Courage:** The mean between Cowardice (too little) and Rashness (too much).
- **Generosity:** The mean between Stinginess and Wastefulness.

## Intuition
"What would Jesus/Gandhi/Beyoncé do?" Virtue ethics relies on role models. You learn to be good by watching good people and imitating them, like learning to play the violin.

## Examples
- **Honesty:** Telling the truth not because of a rule, but because you are an honest person.
- **Compassion:** Feeling the pain of others.
- **Phronesis (Practical Wisdom):** The ability to judge the right thing to do in a specific situation.

## Common Misconceptions
- "It's old-fashioned." (It has made a huge comeback in modern philosophy.)
- "It's culturally relative." (Aristotle thought there was a universal human nature, but different cultures do value different virtues.)

## Related Concepts
- **Care Ethics:** A feminist approach emphasizing relationships and empathy.
- **Confucianism:** A virtue ethics system focused on family and ritual.
- **Stoicism:** Focusing on what you can control.

## Applications
- **Professional Ethics:** The "good doctor" or "good teacher."
- **Education:** Character education.
- **Leadership:** Servant leadership.

## Criticism / Limitations
It doesn't give clear guidance in a crisis. "Be brave" doesn't tell me whether to fight or run in a complex situation.
