## Overview
Social Contract Theory is the view that moral and political obligations are dependent upon a contract or agreement among them to form the society in which they live.

## Core Idea
The core idea is that without rules, life would be a "state of nature" (often chaotic or violent). Therefore, rational people agree to give up some freedom to a sovereign or a set of rules in exchange for safety and order.

## Formal Definition
Morality consists in the set of rules, governing behavior, that rational people will accept, on the condition that others accept them as well.

## Intuition
-   **Traffic Laws:** We all agree to drive on the right side of the road. It limits my freedom (I can't drive anywhere I want), but it keeps me safe. If I break the contract, I am punished.
-   **The Playground:** Kids agree "no hitting" so everyone can play safely.

## Examples
-   **Hobbes:** The State of Nature is a "war of all against all." Life is "nasty, brutish, and short." We need an absolute dictator (Leviathan) to keep order.
-   **Locke:** We have natural rights (life, liberty, property). We form a government to protect these rights. If it fails, we can revolt (basis of the US Declaration of Independence).
-   **Rawls:** "Justice as Fairness." We should design society from behind a "Veil of Ignorance," not knowing if we will be rich or poor.

## Common Misconceptions
-   **Misconception:** There was an actual historical meeting where everyone signed a paper.
    -   **Correction:** It is a *hypothetical* consent. By living in society and accepting its benefits, you implicitly agree to the contract.
-   **Misconception:** It explains all morality.
    -   **Correction:** It struggles to explain duties to those who can't sign the contract (animals, future generations, the severely disabled).

## Related Concepts
-   **State of Nature:** The hypothetical condition of humanity before government.
-   **Implicit Consent:** Agreeing by staying.
-   **Prisoner's Dilemma:** Game theory showing why rational agents might not cooperate without enforcement.

## Applications
-   **Constitution:** A literal social contract.
-   **Civil Disobedience:** Breaking the law when the state has violated the contract (e.g., MLK).

## Criticism and Limitations
-   **The Free Rider:** Why shouldn't I cheat if I can get away with it? (The contract only works if enforced).
-   **No Exit:** It's hard to "opt out" of the social contract if you are born into a state.
