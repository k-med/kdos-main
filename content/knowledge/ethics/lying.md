# Lying

## Overview
Lying is the act of making a false statement with the intention to deceive. The ethics of lying is one of the oldest debates in philosophy.

## Core Idea
Is it ever right to lie?
-   **Absolutist (Kant):** No. Lying treats the other person as a tool and destroys the basis of communication.
-   **Utilitarian:** Yes, if it produces better consequences (e.g., the "white lie").

## Formal Definition
A lie typically requires:
1.  **Falsity:** The statement is false.
2.  **Intent:** The speaker *intends* to deceive.
3.  **Assertion:** The speaker presents the statement as true.

## Intuition
-   **The Murderer at the Door:** (Kant's famous example). A murderer asks where your friend is. Do you lie?
    -   **Kant:** No. You cannot control the consequences, but you can control your own integrity.
    -   **Most People:** Yes! Saving a life is more important than telling the truth.

## Examples
-   **White Lies:** "That dress looks great on you." (Social lubricant).
-   **Noble Lies:** The government lying to the public "for their own good" (Plato's Republic).
-   **Bullshit:** (Frankfurt). The bullshitter doesn't care about truth or falsity; they just want to persuade. This is distinct from lying.

## Common Misconceptions
-   **Misconception:** Lying by omission isn't lying.
    -   **Correction:** Deception can occur without words. Most ethicists consider misleading omissions to be morally similar to lies.
-   **Misconception:** If I cross my fingers, it doesn't count.
    -   **Correction:** Intent is what matters.

## Related Concepts
-   **Deception:** A broader category than lying (includes camouflage, acting).
-   **Truthfulness:** The virtue of loving the truth.
-   **Perjury:** Lying under oath (a crime).

## Applications
-   **Medicine:** Should a doctor tell a patient a grim prognosis if it will destroy their hope? (Therapeutic Privilege).
-   **Politics:** Is it possible to be a successful politician without lying?

## Criticism and Limitations
-   **Trust:** Lying erodes trust. Once you lie, people doubt everything you say.
-   **Complexity:** Sometimes the truth is too complex to explain (e.g., to a child), requiring a simplification that is technically a lie (lie-to-children).
