# Capital Punishment

## Overview
Capital punishment (the death penalty) is the state-sanctioned killing of a person as punishment for a crime. The ethical debate focuses on justice, deterrence, and human rights.

## Core Idea
-   **Retributivism:** "An eye for an eye." Justice requires that the punishment fit the crime. If you kill, you forfeit your life.
-   **Abolitionism:** The state has no right to take a life; it is cruel, unnecessary, and prone to error.

## Formal Definition
-   **Retribution:** Punishment justified by the desert of the offender.
-   **Deterrence:** Punishment justified by its ability to prevent future crimes by others.

## Intuition
-   **The Monster:** For a serial killer who tortured children, many feel a deep intuition that death is the only appropriate punishment (Retribution).
-   **The Innocent:** If we execute one innocent person, is the whole system unjust? (Miscarriage of Justice).

## Examples
-   **Deterrence Argument:** Proponents argue it scares potential murderers. Opponents argue statistics show no clear deterrent effect compared to life imprisonment.
-   **Cost:** Surprisingly, in the US, the death penalty often costs *more* than life in prison due to lengthy legal appeals.

## Common Misconceptions
-   **Misconception:** It's cheaper to kill them.
    -   **Correction:** (See above). Due to due process requirements, it is usually more expensive.
-   **Misconception:** It's about revenge.
    -   **Correction:** Retributivists distinguish "revenge" (personal, emotional) from "retribution" (impersonal, proportional justice).

## Related Concepts
-   **Sanctity of Life:** The view that all life is sacred and should not be taken.
-   **Social Contract:** Beccaria argued we never gave the state the right to kill us when we entered the social contract.
-   **Cruel and Unusual Punishment:** The constitutional standard in the US.

## Applications
-   **Law:** The global trend is towards abolition (most of Europe), but it remains common in the US, China, and the Middle East.
-   **Race and Class:** Statistics often show racial bias in who gets the death penalty, raising justice concerns.

## Criticism and Limitations
-   **Irreversibility:** You can release an innocent prisoner, but you can't resurrect an executed one.
-   **State Power:** Giving the government the power to kill its citizens is dangerous (potential for abuse).
