## Overview
Normative ethics asks: "Is stealing wrong?" Meta-ethics asks: "What are you doing when you say stealing is wrong? Are you stating a fact? Expressing a feeling? Or issuing a command?"

## Core Idea
**Moral Realism vs. Anti-Realism:**
- **Realism:** Moral facts exist independently of us (like gravity). "Murder is wrong" is true even if everyone loves murder.
- **Anti-Realism:** Moral facts do not exist. Morality is invented, subjective, or expressive.

## Formal Definition (if applicable)
**Emotivism:** The view that moral statements are just expressions of emotion. "Stealing is wrong" just means "Boo stealing!" (The Boo-Hurrah Theory).

## Intuition
Is morality like math (objective) or like ice cream flavors (subjective)?
- If it's like math, how do we "see" moral facts? (The Queerness Argument).
- If it's like ice cream, why do we argue about it? (We don't argue about chocolate vs. vanilla).

## Examples
- **Divine Command Theory:** Morality comes from God. (A meta-ethical view about the *source* of morality).
- **Cultural Relativism:** "Good" means "socially approved."
- **Error Theory:** All moral statements are false because they try to describe moral facts that don't exist (like talking about unicorns).

## Common Misconceptions
- "It's useless word games." (It determines whether we can judge Nazis. If relativism is true, we can't say the Nazis were objectively wrong, just that we disagree with them.)

## Related Concepts
- **Is-Ought Problem:** You can't derive an "ought" from an "is." (Hume). Just because something *is* natural doesn't mean it *ought* to be done.
- **Moral Epistemology:** How do we know moral truths? Intuition? Reason?
- **Thick vs. Thin Concepts:** "Good" is thin. "Cruel" is thick (it describes facts *and* evaluates them).

## Applications
- **Law:** Are laws based on morality?
- **Psychology:** Are we born with a moral sense?

## Criticism / Limitations
It's very abstract. You can study meta-ethics all day and still be a bad person.
