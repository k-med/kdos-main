  Cell Theory is a fundamental principle of biology stating that all living organisms are composed of cells, the cell is the basic unit of life, and all cells arise from pre-existing cells.

## Overview
The cell is the smallest unit of life that can replicate independently. Cell theory provides the framework for understanding the structure and function of all living things, from bacteria to humans.

## Core Idea
The theory has three main tenets:
1.  All living organisms are made of one or more cells.
2.  The cell is the basic unit of structure and organization in organisms.
3.  Cells arise from pre-existing cells.

## Formal Definition (if applicable)
**Prokaryotes vs. Eukaryotes:**
- **Prokaryotes:** Simple cells without a nucleus or membrane-bound organelles (e.g., bacteria).
- **Eukaryotes:** Complex cells with a nucleus and organelles (e.g., plants, animals, fungi).

## Intuition
Think of a cell like a tiny factory. It has a control center (nucleus), power plants (mitochondria), assembly lines (ribosomes), and shipping departments (Golgi apparatus), all working together to keep the organism alive.

## Examples
- **Red Blood Cells:** Specialized cells that carry oxygen.
- **Neurons:** Cells that transmit electrical signals in the brain.
- **Amoeba:** A single-celled organism that functions as a complete individual.

## Common Misconceptions
- "Viruses are cells." (Viruses are not considered alive because they cannot reproduce without a host cell and lack cellular structure.)
- "Bigger animals have bigger cells." (They just have *more* cells.)

## Related Concepts
- **Organelles:** Specialized structures within a cell (e.g., mitochondria, chloroplasts).
- **Mitosis/Meiosis:** Processes of cell division.
- **Stem Cells:** Undifferentiated cells capable of giving rise to various cell types.

## Applications
- **Medicine:** Understanding diseases like cancer (uncontrolled cell division).
- **Biotechnology:** Engineering cells to produce insulin or other drugs.
- **Forensics:** DNA analysis relies on cellular material.

## Criticism / Limitations
While cell theory holds true for almost all life, there are exceptions like fungal hyphae (which can be continuous multinucleated tubes) and viruses (which blur the line between living and non-living).
