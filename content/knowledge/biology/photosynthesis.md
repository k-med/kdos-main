## Overview
Photosynthesis converts light energy into chemical energy stored in glucose. It occurs in chloroplasts and releases oxygen as a byproduct, maintaining the breathable atmosphere.

## Core Idea
The overall chemical equation for photosynthesis is:
$$ 6CO_2 + 6H_2O + \text{light energy} \rightarrow C_6H_{12}O_6 + 6O_2 $$

## Formal Definition (if applicable)
The process consists of two stages:
1.  **Light-Dependent Reactions:** Capture solar energy to produce ATP and NADPH.
2.  **Calvin Cycle (Light-Independent):** Uses ATP and NADPH to fix $CO_2$ into glucose.

## Intuition
Plants are solar-powered sugar factories. They take in "exhaust" ($CO_2$) and water, use sunlight to power the machinery, and produce fuel (sugar) and fresh air ($O_2$).

## Examples
- **Leaves:** The primary site of photosynthesis in plants.
- **Cyanobacteria:** The first organisms to perform oxygenic photosynthesis, changing Earth's atmosphere.
- **Algae:** Responsible for a significant portion of global oxygen production.

## Common Misconceptions
- "Plants only photosynthesize during the day and don't respire." (Plants respire 24/7 to use the energy they make; they only photosynthesize when there is light.)
- "Oxygen comes from $CO_2$." (Oxygen is released from the splitting of water molecules.)

## Related Concepts
- **Cellular Respiration:** The reverse process, using glucose to produce energy.
- **Chlorophyll:** The green pigment that absorbs light.
- **Autotrophs:** Organisms that produce their own food.

## Applications
- **Agriculture:** Maximizing crop yields by optimizing photosynthetic efficiency.
- **Renewable Energy:** Artificial photosynthesis aims to create clean fuels.
- **Climate Change:** Forests act as carbon sinks by absorbing $CO_2$.

## Criticism / Limitations
Photosynthesis is actually quite inefficient (only about 1-2% of solar energy is converted to biomass). Rubisco, the key enzyme, is notoriously slow and prone to errors (photorespiration).
