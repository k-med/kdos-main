  Homeostasis is the state of steady internal, physical, and chemical conditions maintained by living systems. This is the condition of optimal functioning for the organism and includes many variables, such as body temperature and fluid balance.

## Overview
The world is chaotic. It gets hot, cold, wet, and dry. But inside your body, it is always exactly 37°C (98.6°F). Your blood is always pH 7.4. Homeostasis ("same standing") is the superpower that allows life to exist independent of the environment. It is the body's internal thermostat.

## Core Idea
The core idea is **Negative Feedback**. If something goes up, the body pushes it down. If it goes down, the body pushes it up. It is a constant dynamic balancing act, like riding a unicycle.

## Formal Definition
The tendency towards a relatively stable equilibrium between interdependent elements, especially as maintained by physiological processes.

## Intuition
Think of the cruise control in a car.
-   **Set Point:** 60 mph.
-   **Sensor:** Speedometer.
-   **Effector:** Engine/Brakes.
If the car goes up a hill and slows down (55 mph), the engine revs up. If it goes down a hill and speeds up (65 mph), the brakes apply. The speed stays constant despite the changing road.

## Examples
-   **Thermoregulation:**
    -   *Too Hot:* You sweat (evaporative cooling) and your blood vessels dilate (vasodilation) to dump heat.
    -   *Too Cold:* You shiver (muscle heat) and your blood vessels constrict (vasoconstriction) to keep heat in the core.
-   **Blood Sugar:**
    -   *High Sugar (after eating):* Pancreas releases Insulin. Cells absorb sugar.
    -   *Low Sugar (fasting):* Pancreas releases Glucagon. Liver releases stored sugar.
-   **Osmoregulation:** If you are dehydrated, your brain (hypothalamus) tells your kidneys to save water (yellow pee) and makes you thirsty.

## Common Misconceptions
-   **It's static:** It's not a frozen state. It is a "dynamic equilibrium." Your levels are constantly wiggling up and down around the set point.
-   **Positive Feedback:** This is the opposite (and rare). It pushes the system *away* from balance. Example: Childbirth. Contractions cause oxytocin, which causes *more* contractions. It leads to an explosive event (birth), not stability.

## Related Concepts
-   **Allostasis:** The process of achieving stability through change (e.g., your heart rate goes up when you run to maintain oxygen levels). It is "predictive" homeostasis.
-   **Entropy:** The universe wants disorder. Homeostasis is the fight against entropy. It costs energy (ATP) to maintain order.

## Applications
-   **Cybernetics:** Engineers use biological homeostasis as a model for designing self-regulating machines and software.
-   **Medicine:** Almost all disease is a failure of homeostasis (e.g., Diabetes = failure of blood sugar regulation).

## Criticism / Limitations
-   **Stress:** Maintaining homeostasis under stress (allostatic load) wears the body down over time, leading to aging and disease.
