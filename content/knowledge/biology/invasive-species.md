  An invasive species is an introduced organism that becomes overpopulated and harms its new environment. Invasive species adversely affect habitats and bioregions, causing ecological, environmental, and/or economic damage.

## Overview
Nature has borders (oceans, mountains). When humans move animals across these borders, chaos ensues. An invasive species is a weed that takes over the garden. It has no natural predators in the new land, so it eats everything and multiplies until the ecosystem collapses.

## Core Idea
The core idea is **Ecological Release**. In its home, the species is kept in check by predators and diseases. In the new home, it is "released" from these checks. It becomes a super-predator.

## Formal Definition
An organism that causes ecological or economic harm in a new environment where it is not native.

## Intuition
Imagine dropping a lion into a flock of sheep that have never seen a lion. The sheep don't run. The lion eats until it explodes. That is an invasive species.

## Examples
-   **Cane Toads (Australia):** Introduced to eat beetles. Instead, they ate everything else. They are poisonous, so anything that tries to eat *them* (crocodiles, snakes) dies. They are an unstoppable biological tank.
-   **Kudzu (USA):** "The vine that ate the South." Introduced from Japan to stop erosion. It grows a foot a day and smothers entire forests.
-   **Rabbits (Australia):** A settler released 24 rabbits for hunting. Within a few years, there were millions. They ate the continent bare.

## Common Misconceptions
-   **All non-natives are invasive:** No. Tomatoes are not native to Italy (from Americas). Potatoes are not native to Ireland. Most crops are non-native but harmless. "Invasive" means *harmful*.
-   **Nature will balance itself:** Eventually, yes (in million years). But in the short term, it means mass extinction.

## Related Concepts
-   **Ballast Water:** Ships fill their tanks with water in one port and dump it in another. This is how zebra mussels invaded the Great Lakes.
-   **Biocontrol:** Introducing *another* species to eat the invasive one. (Risky: see Cane Toads).

## Applications
-   **Border Control:** Customs agents aren't just looking for drugs; they are looking for fruit and bugs that could destroy agriculture.

## Criticism / Limitations
-   **Xenophobia:** Some critics argue the language of "invasion" is too militaristic and mirrors anti-immigrant rhetoric. We should focus on ecosystem function, not just "native vs. alien."
