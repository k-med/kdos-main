  Immunology is the study of the immune system, a complex network of cells and proteins that defends the body against infection. It covers the distinction between self and non-self.

## Overview
The immune system is the body's defense force. Immunology studies how this system recognizes invaders, mounts an attack, and remembers the enemy for next time.

## Core Idea
**Self vs. Non-Self:** The fundamental job of the immune system is to distinguish between the body's own cells ("self") and foreign invaders ("non-self") like bacteria, viruses, or transplants.

## Formal Definition (if applicable)
**Innate Immunity:** The non-specific, immediate defense (e.g., skin, inflammation).
**Adaptive Immunity:** The specific, learned defense (e.g., antibodies, T-cells) that has memory.

## Intuition
Think of it as a castle defense. The moat and walls are the Innate Immune System (keeps everything out). The archers and knights are the Adaptive Immune System (target specific enemies). The library is the Memory B-cells (remembering how to defeat them).

## Examples
- **Vaccination:** Training the immune system with a harmless version of a pathogen so it's ready for the real thing.
- **Allergies:** The immune system overreacting to a harmless substance (pollen).
- **Autoimmune Disease:** The immune system mistakenly attacking the body's own cells (e.g., Lupus, Type 1 Diabetes).

## Common Misconceptions
- "Boosting your immune system is always good." (An overactive immune system causes allergies and autoimmune disease; you want *balance*, not just strength.)
- "Vaccines cause autism." (Debunked by extensive scientific research.)

## Related Concepts
- **Antibody:** A protein produced by B-cells that neutralizes pathogens.
- **Antigen:** A toxin or other foreign substance that induces an immune response.
- **Inflammation:** The body's response to injury or infection.

## Applications
- **Vaccinology:** Developing new vaccines.
- **Cancer Immunotherapy:** Teaching the immune system to attack cancer cells.
- **Transplant Medicine:** Preventing organ rejection.

## Criticism / Limitations
The immune system is incredibly complex and can sometimes cause more harm than good (e.g., cytokine storms). We still don't fully understand how to perfectly modulate it.
