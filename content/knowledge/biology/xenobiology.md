  Xenobiology (or Astrobiology) is the study of life that is not of Earth. It speculates on the nature of extraterrestrial life based on the principles of biology, chemistry, and physics.

## Overview
It is the only science that has no subject matter yet. We have never found a single alien microbe. But we can use what we know about Earth life to guess what *could* be out there. It is the border between biology and science fiction.

## Core Idea
The core idea is **Universal Biology**. Are the rules of life (DNA, cells, carbon) universal, or are they just one option?
-   **Carbon Chauvinism:** The bias that life *must* be carbon-based.
-   **Silicon Life:** Silicon is chemically similar to carbon. Could rock-monsters exist on hot planets?

## Formal Definition
The study of the origin, evolution, distribution, and future of life in the universe.

## Intuition
-   **Biology:** Studying the fish in your aquarium.
-   **Xenobiology:** Asking "Are there fish in the ocean? And do they look like my fish?"

## Examples
-   **Europa:** A moon of Jupiter. It has an ocean of liquid water under miles of ice. NASA is sending a probe (Europa Clipper) to sniff the plumes for signs of life.
-   **Titan:** A moon of Saturn. It has lakes of liquid methane (natural gas). Could life exist there that drinks methane instead of water?
-   **The Goldilocks Zone:** The distance from a star where water is liquid (not ice, not steam). Earth is in the zone. We look for other planets there.

## Common Misconceptions
-   **Aliens will look like humans:** Unlikely. The humanoid shape is a specific result of Earth's evolution. Aliens might look like octopuses or clouds of gas.
-   **We will find radio signals:** SETI listens for radio. But simple life (bacteria) doesn't build radios. We are more likely to find "Biosignatures" (oxygen in the atmosphere) than a message.

## Related Concepts
-   **Fermi Paradox:** "Where is everybody?" If the universe is old and full of stars, why haven't we seen anyone?
-   **Shadow Biosphere:** The idea that there might be a second, unrelated tree of life right here on Earth that we haven't noticed because our tests only look for DNA.

## Applications
-   **Planetary Protection:** NASA has strict rules to not contaminate Mars with Earth bacteria (Forward Contamination) and not bring Mars bacteria back to Earth (Back Contamination).

## Criticism / Limitations
-   **N=1:** We only have one data point (Earth). It is hard to do science with a sample size of one.
