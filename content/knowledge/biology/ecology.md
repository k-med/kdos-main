## Overview
Ecology examines life at the macro scale, from individual organisms to the entire biosphere. It seeks to understand the distribution and abundance of life and the flows of energy and matter through ecosystems.

## Core Idea
**Interdependence:** No organism exists in isolation. Every living thing depends on others (for food, shelter, pollination) and on abiotic factors (sunlight, water, soil).

## Formal Definition (if applicable)
**Ecosystem:** A community of living organisms (biotic) in conjunction with the nonliving components of their environment (abiotic), interacting as a system.

## Intuition
Think of a forest not just as a collection of trees, but as a complex web. The trees need soil bacteria to get nitrogen; the birds need trees for nests and insects for food; the insects need plants. Pull one thread, and the whole web shakes.

## Examples
- **Food Chain:** Grass $\rightarrow$ Grasshopper $\rightarrow$ Frog $\rightarrow$ Snake $\rightarrow$ Hawk.
- **Keystone Species:** Sea otters controlling urchin populations to protect kelp forests.
- **Carbon Cycle:** The movement of carbon between the atmosphere, oceans, and living organisms.

## Common Misconceptions
- "Ecology is just environmentalism." (Ecology is a science; environmentalism is a social/political movement, though they are related.)
- "Balance of nature." (Nature is dynamic and constantly changing, not static.)

## Related Concepts
- **Niche:** The role and position a species has in its environment.
- **Carrying Capacity:** The maximum population size an environment can sustain.
- **Symbiosis:** Close and long-term biological interaction (e.g., mutualism, parasitism).

## Applications
- **Conservation Biology:** Protecting endangered species and habitats.
- **Resource Management:** Sustainable fishing and forestry.
- **Urban Planning:** Designing green cities.

## Criticism / Limitations
Ecological systems are incredibly complex and difficult to predict. Small changes can have cascading, non-linear effects (chaos theory).
