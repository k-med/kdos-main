  Cellular respiration is the metabolic process by which cells break down glucose to produce ATP, the universal energy currency of life. It occurs in the mitochondria of eukaryotic cells.

## Overview
While photosynthesis stores energy in sugar, cellular respiration releases it. It is how organisms (including plants) convert food into usable energy to power cellular activities.

## Core Idea
The overall equation is the reverse of photosynthesis:
$$ C_6H_{12}O_6 + 6O_2 \rightarrow 6CO_2 + 6H_2O + \text{ATP} $$

## Formal Definition (if applicable)
The process has three main stages:
1.  **Glycolysis:** Breaking glucose into pyruvate (in cytoplasm).
2.  **Krebs Cycle (Citric Acid Cycle):** Breaking down pyruvate to release electrons (in mitochondria).
3.  **Oxidative Phosphorylation:** Using electrons to power the Electron Transport Chain and generate ATP.

## Intuition
If glucose is a $100 bill, ATP is a quarter. You can't put a $100 bill into a vending machine (cell process); you need to break it down into quarters (ATP) first. Respiration is the bank that makes change.

## Examples
- **Aerobic Respiration:** Using oxygen to maximize ATP production (36-38 ATP per glucose).
- **Anaerobic Respiration (Fermentation):** Producing energy without oxygen (e.g., yeast making alcohol, muscles making lactic acid).
- **Mitochondria:** The "powerhouse of the cell."

## Common Misconceptions
- "Only animals respire." (Plants respire too!)
- "Breathing is the same as respiration." (Breathing is gas exchange; cellular respiration is the chemical process inside cells.)

## Related Concepts
- **Metabolism:** The sum of all chemical reactions in an organism.
- **ATP (Adenosine Triphosphate):** The molecule that stores and transfers energy.
- **Enzymes:** Proteins that catalyze these reactions.

## Applications
- **Exercise Physiology:** Understanding aerobic vs. anaerobic thresholds.
- **Brewing/Baking:** Using fermentation (anaerobic respiration) to make beer and bread.
- **Toxicology:** Cyanide kills by blocking the Electron Transport Chain.

## Criticism / Limitations
The efficiency of respiration varies. It is not a perfect machine; some energy is always lost as heat (which helps maintain body temperature in mammals).
