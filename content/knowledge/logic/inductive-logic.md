## Overview
**Inductive Logic** deals with reasoning from specific observations to general conclusions. Unlike deductive logic (where the conclusion *must* be true if premises are), inductive logic deals with **probability** and **strength**.

## Core Idea
The core idea is **learning from experience**. If the sun has risen every day for a billion years, it is *reasonable* (though not logically certain) to expect it to rise tomorrow.

## Formal Definition
Inductive logic attempts to formalize the relationship of "support" or "confirmation" between evidence and hypotheses. It often uses **Probability Theory** (specifically Bayesianism) as its calculus.

## Intuition
Deduction is like math: $2+2=4$. Certainty.
Induction is like detective work: "He has the motive, the weapon, and no alibi." High probability, but not absolute certainty.

## Examples
-   **Generalization:** "Every swan I've seen is white. Therefore, all swans are white." (Vulnerable to the "Black Swan").
-   **Analogy:** "Earth has water and life. Mars has water. Therefore, Mars might have life."
-   **Bayesian Update:** Adjusting the probability of a hypothesis (e.g., "I have a disease") based on new evidence (e.g., "Positive test result").

## Common Misconceptions
-   **Misconception:** Induction is just "guessing."
    -   **Correction:** It is reasoned inference based on evidence. Science relies entirely on induction.
-   **Misconception:** Induction proves things.
    -   **Correction:** Induction never *proves* in the mathematical sense; it only confirms or disconfirms to varying degrees.

## Related Concepts
-   **[Deductive Logic](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/logic/deductive-logic.md):** Reasoning from general to specific.
-   **[Abductive Reasoning](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/logic/abductive-reasoning.md):** Inference to the best explanation.
-   **[Problem of Induction](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/philosophy/problem-of-induction.md):** Hume's philosophical argument that induction cannot be rationally justified (because justifying it using past success is circular).

## Applications
-   **Science:** The Scientific Method is essentially formalized inductive logic.
-   **Machine Learning:** Algorithms "induce" patterns from training data to predict new data.
-   **Law:** Juries decide based on "reasonable doubt" (induction), not absolute certainty.

## Criticism and Limitations
-   **Hume's Problem:** We assume the future will resemble the past, but we have no logical proof of this.
-   **Goodman's Paradox:** "Grue" and "Bleen"—shows that formalizing exactly *what* can be projected into the future is difficult.
