## Overview
A **Paradox** is a statement or problem that seems to defy logic or intuition. Paradoxes are not just amusing puzzles; they often reveal deep flaws in our understanding of concepts like truth, infinity, and set theory.

## Core Idea
The core idea is a **collision of intuitions**. We have two or more beliefs that seem obviously true, but when put together, they lead to a contradiction. Resolving the paradox requires abandoning or refining one of those beliefs.

## Formal Definition
A paradox is a statement that runs contrary to one's expectation. In logic, it is a statement that leads to a contradiction (e.g., True = False).

## Intuition
A paradox is a **stress test** for a logical system. Just as engineers test a bridge until it breaks to find weak points, logicians use paradoxes to break systems of thought and build stronger ones.

## Examples
-   **Liar Paradox:** "This sentence is false." If it's true, it's false. If it's false, it's true. (Reveals issues with self-reference and truth predicates).
-   **Sorites Paradox (Heap):** One grain of sand is not a heap. Adding one grain doesn't make a heap. Therefore, a million grains is not a heap. (Reveals issues with vague predicates).
-   **Zeno's Paradoxes:** Achilles can never catch the tortoise because he must first cover half the distance, then half the remaining, ad infinitum. (Reveals issues with infinity and motion).

## Common Misconceptions
-   **Misconception:** A paradox is just a contradiction.
    -   **Correction:** A contradiction is just an error ($A \land \neg A$). A paradox is a contradiction *derived from accepted premises*, forcing us to rethink the premises.
-   **Misconception:** They are unsolvable.
    -   **Correction:** Many paradoxes have standard solutions (e.g., Calculus solved Zeno's paradoxes; Tarski's hierarchy solved the Liar Paradox).

## Related Concepts
-   **[Antinomy](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/philosophy/antinomy.md):** A contradiction between two apparently equally valid principles or conclusions.
-   **[Dilemma](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/logic/dilemma.md):** A situation in which a difficult choice has to be made between two or more alternatives.
-   **[Irony](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/literature/irony.md):** A literary device often confused with paradox.

## Applications
-   **Mathematics:** Russell's Paradox led to the development of modern Set Theory (ZFC).
-   **Physics:** The Twin Paradox and Grandfather Paradox helped clarify Relativity and Time Travel.
-   **Computer Science:** The Halting Problem is essentially a paradox of self-reference applied to algorithms.

## Criticism and Limitations
-   **Word Games:** Some argue that certain paradoxes (like Sorites) are just linguistic confusion rather than deep metaphysical problems.
