## Overview
**Aesthetics** is the philosophy of art and beauty. It asks: What makes something beautiful? Is beauty in the eye of the beholder, or is it an objective quality?

## Core Idea
The core idea is **judgment**. How do we judge art? What criteria do we use? Is a sunset beautiful in the same way a painting is beautiful?

## Formal Definition
The study of sensory or sensori-emotional values, sometimes called judgments of sentiment and taste.

## Intuition
It's the **science of "Wow."**
-   Why does a sad song make us feel good? (Paradox of Tragedy).
-   Why is a forgery worth less than the original, even if they look identical?
-   Can a urinal be art? (Duchamp's Fountain).

## Examples
-   **The Sublime:** The feeling of awe and terror when facing something huge (mountains, storms). Distinct from "Beautiful" (which is calm and pleasing).
-   **Objective vs. Subjective:**
    -   *Hume:* Taste is subjective, but "ideal critics" agree on masterpieces.
    -   *Kant:* Aesthetic judgment claims universal validity ("This *should* be beautiful to everyone").

## Common Misconceptions
-   **Misconception:** It's just about pretty things.
    -   **Correction:** It also studies the ugly, the grotesque, the sublime, and the avant-garde.
-   **Misconception:** There's no accounting for taste.
    -   **Correction:** Philosophers argue we *can* reason about art and educate our taste.

## Related Concepts
-   **[Art Theory](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/art/art-theory.md):** The study of the nature and value of art.
-   **[Beauty](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/aesthetics/beauty.md):** The quality that gives pleasure to the senses.
-   **[Criticism](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/literature/literary-criticism.md):** The practice of judging the merits of works.

## Applications
-   **Design:** UX/UI design relies on aesthetic principles (balance, harmony).
-   **Environmentalism:** Arguments for preserving nature often rely on its aesthetic value.

## Criticism and Limitations
-   **Elitism:** Aesthetics has historically focused on "High Art" (opera, painting) and ignored "Low Art" (comics, pop music).
