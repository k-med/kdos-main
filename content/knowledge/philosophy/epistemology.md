## Overview
**Epistemology** is the study of knowledge. It asks: What do we know? How do we know it? And how can we be sure we aren't wrong?

## Core Idea
The core idea is **justification**. It's not enough to believe something true (you could be lucky). To have *knowledge*, you need a good reason (justification) for your belief.

## Formal Definition
Classically defined as **Justified True Belief (JTB)**.
$S$ knows that $P$ if and only if:
1.  $P$ is true.
2.  $S$ believes that $P$.
3.  $S$ is justified in believing that $P$.

## Intuition
It's the **audit of the mind**.
-   "I know it's raining." (How? I see water falling).
-   "I know God exists." (How? Faith? Logic? Experience?).
-   "I know $E=mc^2$." (How? I trust Einstein).

## Examples
-   **Rationalism:** We know things through reason alone (Descartes: "I think, therefore I am").
-   **Empiricism:** We know things through sensory experience (Hume: "All knowledge comes from impressions").
-   **Skepticism:** We can't really know anything (The Matrix scenario).

## Common Misconceptions
-   **Misconception:** Knowledge is just strong belief.
    -   **Correction:** You can strongly believe the earth is flat, but you can't *know* it (because it's false).
-   **Misconception:** Science is the only way to know things.
    -   **Correction:** That is "Scientism." We also know logical truths ($A=A$) and ethical truths (Torture is wrong) without using the scientific method.

## Applications
-   **Law:** Evidence and "Reasonable Doubt" are epistemological standards.
-   **AI:** Machine Learning is essentially computational epistemology (learning from data).

## Criticism and Limitations
-   **Regress Problem:** If every belief needs a reason, and that reason needs a reason... do we go on forever (Infinitism), go in a circle (Coherentism), or stop at a bedrock foundation (Foundationalism)?
