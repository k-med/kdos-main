## Overview
**Existentialism** is the philosophy of the individual. It argues that the universe has no inherent meaning, so we are free (and condemned) to create our own meaning.

## Core Idea
The core idea is **Existence precedes Essence**. We are born first (existence), and then we define who we are through our choices (essence). There is no blueprint for a human being.

## Formal Definition
A philosophical movement emphasizing individual existence, freedom, and choice. It holds that humans define their own meaning in an irrational universe.

## Intuition
It's **radical responsibility**.
-   **The Absurd:** We crave meaning, but the universe is silent. (Camus).
-   **Angst:** The dizziness of freedom. Realizing you could do *anything* is terrifying.
-   **Bad Faith:** Pretending you have no choice ("I had to follow orders") to escape the burden of freedom.

## Examples
-   **Myth of Sisyphus:** Sisyphus pushes a rock up a hill forever. Camus says we must imagine him happy. The struggle itself is enough.
-   **God is Dead:** Nietzsche argued that without religious certainty, we must become "Ubermensch" (Overmen) and create our own values.

## Common Misconceptions
-   **Misconception:** It's just being depressed and wearing black.
    -   **Correction:** It's actually a philosophy of action and freedom. It empowers you to take control of your life.
-   **Misconception:** It's nihilism (belief in nothing).
    -   **Correction:** Nihilism says there is no meaning. Existentialism says there is no *inherent* meaning, so you must *make* one.

## Related Concepts

-   **[Absurdism](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/philosophy/absurdism.md):** The conflict between the human tendency to seek inherent value and meaning in life and the human inability to find any.

## Applications
-   **Psychotherapy:** Existential Therapy helps patients confront death, freedom, and meaninglessness.
-   **Literature:** Dostoevsky, Kafka, and Beckett explore these themes.

## Criticism and Limitations
-   **Individualism:** It can be too focused on the self and ignore social/structural forces.
-   **Ambiguity:** It offers no clear moral rules, which can be paralyzing.
