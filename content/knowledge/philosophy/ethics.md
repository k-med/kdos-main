## Overview
**Ethics** (Moral Philosophy) is the study of how we ought to live. It moves beyond "what is" to "what should be." It explores concepts of right and wrong, justice, and virtue.

## Core Idea
The core idea is **value**. Not financial value, but moral value. What makes an action "good"? Is it the outcome? The intent? The character of the actor?

## Formal Definition
The three main branches are:
1.  **Meta-ethics:** What *is* goodness? (Is it objective?).
2.  **Normative Ethics:** What rules should we follow? (Utilitarianism vs. Kantianism).
3.  **Applied Ethics:** How do we apply rules to real issues? (Abortion, Euthanasia).

## Intuition
It's the **User Manual for being human**.
-   **Trolley Problem:** Do you kill one person to save five?
-   **Golden Rule:** Treat others as you want to be treated.

## Examples
-   **Utilitarianism (Mill):** The best action is the one that maximizes overall happiness.
-   **Deontology (Kant):** Some actions (lying, murder) are wrong regardless of the consequences. You have a duty to follow moral laws.
-   **Virtue Ethics (Aristotle):** Focuses on character. Be a brave, wise, and temperate person, and you will do the right thing.

## Common Misconceptions
-   **Misconception:** Ethics is just religion.
    -   **Correction:** Secular ethics (like Utilitarianism) relies on reason, not scripture.
-   **Misconception:** It's all subjective (Relativism).
    -   **Correction:** Most philosophers argue for some objective moral truths (e.g., "Torturing babies for fun is wrong").

## Related Concepts
-   **[Political Philosophy](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/philosophy/political-philosophy.md):** Ethics applied to groups/states.
-   **[Bioethics](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/medicine/medical-ethics.md):** Ethics in medicine.
-   **[Altruism](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/ethics/altruism.md):** Selfless concern for the well-being of others.

## Applications
-   **Business:** Corporate Social Responsibility.
-   **Technology:** AI Safety (Teaching robots not to kill us).

## Criticism and Limitations
-   **Demandingness:** Some theories (like Utilitarianism) demand we give away all our money to save lives, which seems impossible for most people.
