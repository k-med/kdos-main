## Overview
**Metaphysics** is the study of the fundamental nature of reality. It goes "beyond physics" (meta-physics) to ask questions that science cannot (yet) answer.

## Core Idea
The core idea is **structure**. What is the universe made of at the most basic level? Not just atoms, but "objects," "properties," "events," and "causes."

## Formal Definition
The study of being qua being. It includes:
-   **Ontology:** What exists?
-   **Cosmology:** How did the universe begin?
-   **Universal Science:** The study of first principles.

## Intuition
Physics asks: "How does gravity work?"
Metaphysics asks: "What *is* a law of nature? Is it a physical thing? A pattern? A command from God?"

## Examples
-   **Mind-Body Problem:** Is the mind physical?
-   **Free Will:** Is the future determined?
-   **Universals:** Do "Redness" and "Triangularity" exist, or are they just words?

## Common Misconceptions
-   **Misconception:** It's about crystals and healing.
    -   **Correction:** That's "New Age" metaphysics. Academic metaphysics is rigorous, logical analysis of reality.
-   **Misconception:** It's useless speculation.
    -   **Correction:** Every worldview is based on metaphysical assumptions (e.g., Materialism is a metaphysical stance).

## Related Concepts
-   **[Epistemology](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/philosophy/epistemology.md):** How do we know reality?
-   **[Logic](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/philosophy/logic.md):** The tool used to do metaphysics.
-   **[Physics](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/physics/physics.md):** The science that metaphysics interprets.

## Applications
-   **Science:** Paradigm shifts (like Relativity) often start as metaphysical questions about space and time.
-   **Religion:** Theology is essentially applied metaphysics.

## Criticism and Limitations
-   **Positivism:** The Logical Positivists argued that metaphysical statements are meaningless because they cannot be verified empirically. (Though this view is largely dead now).
