## Overview
**Philosophy of Science** asks: What is science? How does it work? Does it tell us the truth? It examines the logic and methods behind scientific discovery.

## Core Idea
The core idea is **demarcation**. How do we distinguish science (astronomy) from non-science (astrology) or pseudoscience?

## Formal Definition
The study of the assumptions, foundations, and implications of science. It concerns the reliability of scientific theories and the ultimate purpose of science.

## Intuition
Scientists are the players; Philosophers of Science are the referees checking the rulebook.
-   **Popper:** Science is about *falsification*. You can't prove a theory true, only false. (Swans example).
-   **Kuhn:** Science isn't a steady march of progress. It moves in jumps called **Paradigm Shifts**. (Newton -> Einstein).

## Examples
-   **Problem of Induction:** We assume the future will be like the past. Can we prove it? (Hume says no).
-   **Underdetermination:** Evidence can often support multiple rival theories. How do we choose? (Occam's Razor).
-   **Theory-Ladenness:** Observation is not neutral. What you see depends on what you believe (e.g., looking at an X-ray requires training).

## Common Misconceptions
-   **Misconception:** Science proves facts.
    -   **Correction:** Science provides *provisional* best explanations. Everything is open to revision.
-   **Misconception:** The "Scientific Method" is a single simple recipe.
    -   **Correction:** Real science is messy, creative, and diverse. There is no single method used by all scientists (Feyerabend).

## Related Concepts
-   **[Epistemology](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/philosophy/epistemology.md):** The theory of knowledge.
-   **[Scientific Realism](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/metaphysics/realism-vs-anti-realism.md):** Do atoms really exist?
-   **[Pseudoscience](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/science/pseudoscience.md):** Beliefs or practices mistakenly regarded as being based on scientific method.

## Applications
-   **Policy:** Evaluating climate change models or medical studies.
-   **Education:** Teaching critical thinking and the nature of evidence.

## Criticism and Limitations
-   **Disconnect:** Many working scientists (like Feynman) think philosophy of science is useless to them ("Ornithology for birds").
