## Overview
**Phenomenology** is the study of "phenomena": things as they appear to our experience. It asks: What is it *like* to experience something? It puts aside questions of "objective reality" to focus on the subjective viewpoint.

## Core Idea
The core idea is **"To the things themselves!"** (Husserl). We should describe experience exactly as it happens, without scientific or theoretical biases.

## Formal Definition
The study of structures of consciousness as experienced from the first-person point of view. The central structure of an experience is its **Intentionality** (being directed toward something).

## Intuition
Science explains the wavelength of light (Red). Phenomenology describes the *experience* of seeing Red.
-   **Bracketing (Epoché):** Suspending judgment about whether the world is "real" to focus purely on the experience itself.

## Examples
-   **Heidegger's Hammer:** To us, a hammer isn't an object with mass/shape; it's "ready-to-hand" (a tool for hammering). We only notice it as an object ("present-at-hand") when it breaks.
-   **The Gaze (Sartre):** The experience of being looked at by another person changes my world. I become an object in *their* world.

## Common Misconceptions
-   **Misconception:** It's just introspection.
    -   **Correction:** Introspection is looking inside. Phenomenology is analyzing the *structure* of how we look at the world.
-   **Misconception:** It denies reality.
    -   **Correction:** It doesn't deny it; it just says our primary access to reality is through experience.

## Related Concepts
-   **[Existentialism](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/philosophy/existentialism.md):** Grew out of phenomenology.
-   **[Qualia](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/philosophy/qualia.md):** The subjective component of sense perceptions.
-   **[Ontology](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/metaphysics/ontology.md):** Heidegger used phenomenology to do ontology (study of Being).

## Applications
-   **Psychology:** Understanding how patients experience their illness.
-   **Architecture:** Designing spaces based on how they are experienced, not just how they look.

## Criticism and Limitations
-   **Solipsism:** Can be hard to escape the "prison of the self."
-   **Difficulty:** The texts (especially Heidegger) are notoriously difficult and jargon-heavy.
