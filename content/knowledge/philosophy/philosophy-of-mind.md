## Overview
**Philosophy of Mind** explores the nature of mental phenomena. It asks: What is a mind? Is it a physical thing? Can a computer have one?

## Core Idea
The core idea is the **relationship between the mental and the physical**. How does the grey matter in your skull produce the Technicolor movie of your life?

## Formal Definition
The study of the mind, mental events, mental functions, mental properties, consciousness, and their relationship to the physical body, particularly the brain.

## Intuition
-   **Dualism:** Mind and Body are separate. (Ghost in the machine).
-   **Physicalism:** Mind = Brain. (Meat machine).
-   **Functionalism:** Mind is what the brain *does*. (Software).

## Examples
-   **Chinese Room Argument:** Searle argued that a computer could simulate understanding Chinese (by following rules) without actually understanding it. Therefore, syntax $\neq$ semantics.
-   **Bats:** Thomas Nagel asked "What is it like to be a bat?" to show that subjective experience (qualia) cannot be fully explained by objective science.

## Common Misconceptions
-   **Misconception:** It's just psychology.
    -   **Correction:** Psychology studies *how* the mind works (memory, behavior). Philosophy asks *what* it is (ontology).
-   **Misconception:** We solved it.
    -   **Correction:** Consciousness remains the "Hard Problem." We have no idea how matter creates experience.

## Related Concepts
-   **[Mind-Body Problem](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/metaphysics/mind-body-problem.md):** The central issue in the field.
-   **[Cognitive Science](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/psychology/cognitive-science.md):** The interdisciplinary study of mind (AI, Neuroscience, Philosophy).
-   **[Intentionality](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/philosophy/intentionality.md):** The power of minds to be *about* something (representation).

## Applications
-   **AI:** Can we build a conscious robot? If we upload your brain to a computer, is it still you?
-   **Animal Rights:** Do animals feel pain? Do they have minds?

## Criticism and Limitations
-   **Intuition Pumps:** Philosophers often rely on weird thought experiments (Zombies, Swampman) that might be misleading.
