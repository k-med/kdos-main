## Overview
**Logic** is the anatomy of thought. It is the study of correct reasoning. It provides the rules for moving from premises to valid conclusions.

## Core Idea
The core idea is **validity**. An argument is valid if the conclusion *must* follow from the premises. Logic doesn't care if the premises are true (that's science); it cares if the structure is correct.

## Formal Definition
The study of the principles of correct inference.
-   **Deductive Logic:** Certainty (If A then B. A. Therefore B).
-   **Inductive Logic:** Probability (The sun rose yesterday, so it will rise today).

## Intuition
Logic is the **grammar of reason**. Just as grammar rules tell you how to build a sentence, logic rules tell you how to build an argument.

## Examples
-   **Syllogism:**
    1.  All men are mortal.
    2.  Socrates is a man.
    3.  Therefore, Socrates is mortal.
-   **Modus Tollens:**
    1.  If it is raining, the ground is wet.
    2.  The ground is not wet.
    3.  Therefore, it is not raining.

## Common Misconceptions
-   **Misconception:** "Logical" means "unemotional" (like Spock).
    -   **Correction:** Logic is a system of rules, not a personality trait. You can logically analyze emotions.
-   **Misconception:** Logic proves truth.
    -   **Correction:** Logic only preserves truth. Garbage in, garbage out. (Valid argument + False premises = False conclusion).

## Related Concepts
-   **[Fallacy](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/logic/fallacies.md):** A flaw in reasoning.
-   **[Mathematics](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/mathematics/mathematics.md):** Math is essentially logic applied to numbers and structures (Russell/Whitehead).
-   **[Computer Science](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/computer-science/computer-science.md):** Computers are logic machines (0s and 1s).

## Applications
-   **Programming:** Boolean logic (AND, OR, NOT) is the basis of all code.
-   **Law:** Constructing sound legal arguments.
-   **Philosophy:** The primary tool for analyzing concepts.

## Criticism and Limitations
-   **Paradoxes:** Logic can lead to contradictions (This sentence is false) that are hard to resolve.
-   **Incompleteness:** Gödel showed that logic cannot prove everything about math.
