## Overview
Words aren't the smallest units of meaning. "Unhappiness" has three parts: Un- (not), happy (emotion), -ness (state of being). These parts are Lego bricks for building words.

## Core Idea
**Morpheme:** The smallest meaningful unit in a language.
- **Free Morpheme:** Can stand alone ("Dog").
- **Bound Morpheme:** Must be attached ("-s" in "Dogs").

## Formal Definition (if applicable)
**Derivation vs. Inflection:**
- **Derivation:** Creates a new word (Happy -> Unhappy). Changes meaning or part of speech.
- **Inflection:** Changes the grammatical form (Dog -> Dogs, Walk -> Walked). Same word, different version.

## Intuition
- **Agglutinative Languages:** Sticking lots of morphemes together like a train. (Turkish, Finnish). "Evlerinizden" = From your houses (Ev-ler-iniz-den).
- **Isolating Languages:** One word = One morpheme. (Chinese, Vietnamese).

## Examples
- **Compounding:** Joining two roots (Blackbird, Toothbrush).
- **Acronyms:** NASA, Laser.
- **Portmanteau:** Smog (Smoke + Fog), Brunch (Breakfast + Lunch).

## Common Misconceptions
- "Long words are sophisticated." (Often they are just piled-up morphology. "Antidisestablishmentarianism").

## Related Concepts
- **Allomorph:** Different sounds for the same morpheme. (Plural "-s" sounds like /s/ in "Cats" but /z/ in "Dogs").
- **Productivity:** Can you use the rule to make new words? ("-able" is productive: "Googleable").

## Applications
- **Natural Language Processing:** Stemming (cutting off endings) to search for words.
- **Neologisms:** Inventing new words.

## Criticism / Limitations
"Word" is hard to define. Is "ice cream" one word or two?
