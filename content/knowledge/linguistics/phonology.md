## Overview
Phonetics is about *sounds* (physics). Phonology is about *sound systems* (grammar). It's the difference between hearing a noise and hearing a word.

## Core Idea
**Phoneme:** The smallest unit of sound that changes meaning.
- "Bat" vs. "Pat". /b/ and /p/ are phonemes in English because swapping them changes the word.

## Formal Definition (if applicable)
**Allophone:** Different variations of the same phoneme that don't change meaning.
- The "p" in "pin" is aspirated (puff of air).
- The "p" in "spin" is unaspirated (no puff).
- To an English speaker, they sound the same. To a Hindi speaker, they are different phonemes.

## Intuition
**Minimal Pair Test:** If you have two words that differ by only one sound and have different meanings, those sounds are separate phonemes. (e.g., Rice/Lice. In Japanese, R and L are allophones of the same phoneme, which is why they are hard to distinguish).

## Examples
- **Syllable Structure:** English allows complex clusters ("Strengths"). Japanese prefers CV (Consonant-Vowel) like "Sushi".
- **Tone:** In Mandarin, "Ma" can mean Mother, Hemp, Horse, or Scold depending on the pitch. English is not a tonal language (though we use intonation for questions).

## Common Misconceptions
- "It's just pronunciation." (It's about the mental rules of sound. e.g., English speakers know "Bnick" is not a possible word, but "Blick" is).

## Related Concepts
- **Phonotactics:** Rules about which sounds can go together.
- **Assimilation:** Sounds becoming like their neighbors ("Handbag" -> "Hambag").

## Applications
- **Language Teaching:** Teaching learners to hear new contrasts.
- **Poetry:** Rhyme and meter.

## Criticism / Limitations
The line between phonetics and phonology is sometimes blurry.
