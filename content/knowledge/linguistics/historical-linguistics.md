## Overview
Languages evolve like species. Latin didn't die; it turned into French, Spanish, and Italian. Historical linguistics traces the family tree.

## Core Idea
**Proto-Indo-European (PIE):** The ancestor of English, Hindi, Russian, and Greek. Spoken 6,000 years ago on the Pontic Steppe. We have no written records, but we can reconstruct it by comparing its descendants.

## Formal Definition (if applicable)
**Grimm's Law:** A regular sound change that separated Germanic languages (English, German) from others.
- PIE *p -> Germanic *f. (Latin *Pater* -> English *Father*).
- PIE *t -> Germanic *th. (Latin *Tres* -> English *Three*).

## Intuition
- **The Comparative Method:** If you see "Mother" (English), "Mutter" (German), "Madre" (Spanish), "Mat" (Russian), "Mata" (Sanskrit), you assume they came from a common source (*Mater).

## Examples
- **Great Vowel Shift:** In the 1400s, English vowels moved up. "Bite" used to sound like "Beet". This is why English spelling is so weird (it reflects the old pronunciation).
- **Semantic Drift:** "Nice" used to mean "foolish." "Awful" used to mean "full of awe."

## Common Misconceptions
- "Older languages are simpler." (Actually, ancient languages like Sanskrit and Latin had very complex grammar).
- "Language decay." (Change isn't decay; it's adaptation. "Literally" meaning "figuratively" is just semantic drift).

## Related Concepts
- **Loanwords:** Borrowing words (Sushi, Taco, Kindergarten).
- **Sprachbund:** Languages sharing features because they are neighbors, not relatives (The Balkans).

## Applications
- **History:** Tracking human migration (e.g., the Bantu expansion in Africa).
- **Decipherment:** Cracking ancient scripts (Linear B).

## Criticism / Limitations
We can't go back forever. Beyond 10,000 years, the signal is too faint.
