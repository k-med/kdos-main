## Overview
Semantics is what the words mean. Pragmatics is what the *speaker* means.
A: "Do you have a watch?"
B: "It's 5:30."
Semantically, B didn't answer the question. Pragmatically, B understood A wanted the time.

## Core Idea
**Grice's Maxims:** We assume people are cooperating in conversation.
1.  **Quantity:** Say enough, but not too much.
2.  **Quality:** Tell the truth.
3.  **Relation:** Be relevant.
4.  **Manner:** Be clear.

## Formal Definition (if applicable)
**Implicature:** Meaning that is suggested but not explicitly stated. "Nice weather" (when it's raining) implies sarcasm.

## Intuition
- **Speech Acts (Austin):** Words can *do* things.
    - "I bet you \$5." (Making a bet).
    - "I pronounce you husband and wife." (Creating a marriage).
    - "I apologize." (Performing an apology).

## Examples
- **Politeness:** "Could you pass the salt?" is a command disguised as a question to be polite.
- **Deixis:** Words that depend on context. "I am here now." (Who is I? Where is here? When is now?).

## Common Misconceptions
- "It's just reading between the lines." (It's a systematic set of rules we all follow unconsciously).

## Related Concepts
- **Presupposition:** "Have you stopped beating your wife?" (Presupposes you were beating her).
- **Irony/Sarcasm:** Saying the opposite of what you mean.

## Applications
- **AI:** Chatbots need pragmatics to not sound robotic.
- **Law:** "I didn't *say* that." (But you implied it).

## Criticism / Limitations
It's hard to formalize. Context is infinite.
