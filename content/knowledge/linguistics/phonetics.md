## Overview
How do you make a "P" sound? You close your lips, build up air pressure, and release it. Phonetics is the physics and biology of speech.

## Core Idea
**International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA):** A system where one symbol = one sound. English spelling is a mess ("tough", "though", "thought"), but IPA is consistent.
- "Cat" = /kæt/
- "Fish" = /fɪʃ/

## Formal Definition (if applicable)
**Articulatory Phonetics:** How the vocal tract (tongue, lips, teeth) makes sounds.
- **Place of Articulation:** Where the obstruction is (Bilabial = Lips).
- **Manner of Articulation:** How the air is stopped (Stop, Fricative, Nasal).
- **Voicing:** Are the vocal cords vibrating? (S vs. Z).

## Intuition
Put your hand on your throat. Say "Ssssss." Now say "Zzzzzz." You feel a buzz for Z. That's voicing. Your mouth is in the exact same shape for both.

## Examples
- **Vowels:** Made with an open mouth. Defined by tongue height (High/Low) and frontness (Front/Back).
- **Consonants:** Made by blocking air.
- **Clicks:** Sounds used in some African languages (Xhosa) but not English.

## Common Misconceptions
- "Letters are sounds." (No, "Th" is two letters but one sound /θ/ or /ð/).
- "Accents are wrong." (Every dialect has a consistent phonetic system).

## Related Concepts
- **Acoustic Phonetics:** Analyzing sound waves (Spectrograms).
- **Auditory Phonetics:** How the ear and brain hear sound.

## Applications
- **Speech Therapy:** Helping people pronounce words correctly.
- **Forensics:** Voice identification.
- **Acting:** Learning accents.

## Criticism / Limitations
It treats sounds in isolation, but in real speech, sounds blur together (Coarticulation).
