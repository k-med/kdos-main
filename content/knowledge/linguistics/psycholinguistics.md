## Overview
How does the brain turn air vibrations into thoughts? And thoughts into air vibrations? It's the engineering of the mind.

## Core Idea
**Language Acquisition:** How do babies learn language?
- **Behaviorism (Skinner):** Imitation and reward.
- **Nativism (Chomsky):** We are born with a "Language Acquisition Device" (LAD). The "Poverty of the Stimulus" argument says kids learn too fast to just be copying.

## Formal Definition (if applicable)
**Critical Period Hypothesis:** If you don't learn a language before puberty, you will never be fully native-like (especially in grammar/accent). (Case of Genie).

## Intuition
- **Garden Path Sentences:** "The old man the boat." You read "The old man" as a noun phrase, then realize "man" is the verb. Your brain has to backtrack. This shows we parse incrementally.

## Examples
- **Broca's Aphasia:** Damage to the left frontal lobe. Speech is halting and ungrammatical ("Book... table... give"). Comprehension is okay.
- **Wernicke's Aphasia:** Damage to the temporal lobe. Speech is fluent but meaningless ("Word salad"). Comprehension is poor.
- **Tip of the Tongue:** You know the word, but can't retrieve the sound. Shows that meaning and sound are stored separately.

## Common Misconceptions
- "Bilingualism confuses kids." (No, it actually improves executive function/cognitive control).
- "Thinking is just silent speech." (We can think without words—images, concepts).

## Related Concepts
- **Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis:** Does language determine thought? (Strong version: Yes. Weak version: It influences attention).
- **Dyslexia:** Trouble mapping sounds to letters.

## Applications
- **Education:** Reading instruction (Phonics vs. Whole Language).
- **AI:** Modeling human processing.

## Criticism / Limitations
Brain imaging (fMRI) is still coarse. We know *where* language happens, but not exactly *how*.
