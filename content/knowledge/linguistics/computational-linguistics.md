## Overview
Teaching computers to speak human. From the early days of rule-based systems to the modern era of Deep Learning and LLMs (Large Language Models).

## Core Idea
**Statistical vs. Symbolic:**
- **Symbolic (Old School):** Hand-coding grammar rules. (If Noun + Verb...). Good for precision, bad for ambiguity.
- **Statistical (Modern):** Feeding the computer billions of words and letting it learn the patterns (probabilities). "The cat sat on the..." (Mat: 90%, Hat: 5%).

## Formal Definition (if applicable)
**Word Embeddings (Vectors):** Representing words as numbers in a multi-dimensional space. "King" - "Man" + "Woman" = "Queen". This allows computers to understand meaning and analogy.

## Intuition
- **Machine Translation:** Google Translate. Used to be word-for-word (terrible). Now uses Neural Networks to translate whole sentences (fluent).
- **Speech Recognition:** Siri/Alexa. Turning sound waves into text.

## Examples
- **LLMs (GPT, Gemini):** Predicting the next word. It turns out if you do this well enough, you get reasoning, coding, and poetry.
- **Sentiment Analysis:** Reading tweets to see if people are happy or angry about a movie.

## Common Misconceptions
- "The AI understands." (It manipulates symbols/probabilities. Whether it has "understanding" is a philosophical debate).
- "It's solved." (Still struggles with sarcasm, deep context, and hallucination).

## Related Concepts
- **Turing Test:** Can a machine fool a human?
- **Corpus Linguistics:** Analyzing huge databases of text to see how language is actually used.

## Applications
- **Search:** Google.
- **Accessibility:** Screen readers for the blind.
- **Customer Service:** Chatbots.

## Criticism / Limitations
Bias. If the training data is biased (sexist/racist), the AI will be too.
