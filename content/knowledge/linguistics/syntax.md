## Overview
"Colorless green ideas sleep furiously." (Chomsky). This sentence is nonsense, but it is grammatically correct. Syntax is the structure, not the meaning.

## Core Idea
**Generative Grammar:** The brain has a finite set of rules that can generate an infinite number of sentences. You can understand a sentence you have never heard before.

## Formal Definition (if applicable)
**Recursion:** The ability to put a sentence inside a sentence. "I think that [he knows that [she said that...]]". This is what makes human language unique (arguably).

## Intuition
- **Tree Diagrams:** Sentences aren't strings of beads; they are trees.
    - S (Sentence) -> NP (Noun Phrase) + VP (Verb Phrase).
    - "The cat" (NP) + "sat on the mat" (VP).

## Examples
- **Word Order:**
    - SVO (Subject-Verb-Object): English ("I eat apples").
    - SOV: Japanese ("I apples eat").
    - VSO: Irish ("Eat I apples").
- **Ambiguity:** "I shot an elephant in my pajamas." (Did I shoot him while I was wearing pajamas, or did I shoot an elephant who was wearing my pajamas?). Syntax explains why both are possible.

## Common Misconceptions
- "Grammar is about not ending sentences with prepositions." (That's *prescriptive* grammar—etiquette. Syntax is *descriptive* grammar—how people actually speak).
- "Animals have syntax." (They have communication, but mostly lack recursion and hierarchical structure).

## Related Concepts
- **Universal Grammar (UG):** The theory that all humans are born with a blueprint for language.
- **Constituency:** Groups of words that stick together.

## Applications
- **Compilers:** Programming languages have strict syntax.
- **AI:** Parsing sentences to understand commands.

## Criticism / Limitations
Is Universal Grammar real? Some linguists argue language is learned purely from input, without an innate blueprint.
