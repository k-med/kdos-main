## Overview
Syntax is the skeleton; Semantics is the flesh. It's the study of what words and sentences actually *mean*.

## Core Idea
**Sense vs. Reference (Frege):**
- **Reference:** The thing in the world the word points to. "The Morning Star" and "The Evening Star" both refer to Venus.
- **Sense:** The way the word presents that thing. They have different senses (one implies morning, one evening).

## Formal Definition (if applicable)
**Truth-Conditional Semantics:** To know the meaning of a sentence is to know the conditions under which it would be true. "Snow is white" is true iff snow is white.

## Intuition
- **Synonymy:** Same meaning (Big/Large).
- **Antonymy:** Opposite meaning (Hot/Cold).
- **Hyponymy:** Specific to General (Rose is a hyponym of Flower).

## Examples
- **Polysemy:** One word, related meanings. "Head" (body part) and "Head" (of a department).
- **Homonymy:** One word, unrelated meanings. "Bank" (river) and "Bank" (money).
- **Metaphor:** "Time is money." Mapping one domain to another.

## Common Misconceptions
- "Dictionaries define meaning." (Dictionaries just record usage. Meaning is in the minds of speakers).
- "Etymology is meaning." (The history of a word doesn't tell you its current meaning. "Decimate" used to mean kill 1 in 10; now it means destroy).

## Related Concepts
- **Compositionality:** The meaning of the whole is the sum of the parts. (Red + Ball = Red Ball).
- **Prototype Theory:** A robin is a "better" bird than a penguin. We think in prototypes, not strict definitions.

## Applications
- **Search Engines:** Understanding what you are looking for, not just matching keywords.
- **Law:** Interpreting the meaning of statutes.

## Criticism / Limitations
Context matters. "It's cold in here" might mean "Close the window," not just a statement about temperature. That's Pragmatics.
