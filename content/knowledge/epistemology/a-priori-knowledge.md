## Overview
How do you know that "All bachelors are unmarried"? You don't need to interview every bachelor. You just know it by the definition of the words. That's *a priori*.

## Core Idea
**Analytic vs. Synthetic:**
- **Analytic:** True by definition ("Triangles have 3 sides").
- **Synthetic:** True by experience ("The cat is on the mat").
Kant asked: Is there "Synthetic A Priori" knowledge? (Knowledge about the world that we know without looking?).

## Formal Definition (if applicable)
**Necessary Truth:** A statement that *must* be true in all possible worlds ($2+2=4$).
**Contingent Truth:** A statement that happens to be true but could have been false (The sky is blue).

## Intuition
- **A Priori:** From the armchair. (Math, Logic).
- **A Posteriori:** From the lab. (Physics, Biology).

## Examples
- "Something cannot be both red and green all over at the same time." (A priori).
- "Water boils at 100°C." (A posteriori—we had to measure it).
- "I think, therefore I am." (A priori).

## Common Misconceptions
- "A priori means 'before'." (It means independent of experience, not necessarily chronologically before.)
- "It's innate." (You might need to learn the language first, but the *justification* doesn't depend on experience.)

## Related Concepts
- **Rationalism:** The view that reason is the chief source of knowledge (Descartes, Spinoza, Leibniz).
- **Empiricism:** The view that experience is the chief source (Locke, Berkeley, Hume).
- **Innate Ideas:** Concepts we are born with (God? Geometry?).

## Applications
- **Mathematics:** Purely a priori.
- **Ethics:** Are moral truths a priori? (e.g., "Torture is wrong").
- **Metaphysics:** Trying to figure out the structure of reality using only reason.

## Criticism / Limitations
Quine argued that the analytic/synthetic distinction is blurry. Maybe even math is just very well-confirmed empirical knowledge.
