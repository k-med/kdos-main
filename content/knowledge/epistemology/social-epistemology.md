## Overview
Traditional epistemology imagines a lone thinker (Rodin's Thinker) figuring out the world. Social epistemology recognizes that 99% of what we know comes from other people (books, teachers, scientists).

## Core Idea
**Testimony:** Relying on the word of others. Is it a fundamental source of knowledge (like eyesight), or do we need to verify it first?

## Formal Definition (if applicable)
**Epistemic Injustice:** When someone is wronged in their capacity as a knower.
- **Testimonial Injustice:** Not believing someone because of prejudice (e.g., ignoring a woman's testimony).
- **Hermeneutical Injustice:** When a group lacks the concepts to understand their own experience (e.g., before the term "sexual harassment" existed).

## Intuition
- **Experts:** When should you trust a scientist over your own gut?
- **Echo Chambers:** When groups reinforce their own biases and exclude outside views.
- **Wikipedia:** A prime example of social knowledge construction.

## Examples
- **Peer Review:** Science's social mechanism for truth-checking.
- **Juries:** A group trying to determine the facts.
- **Democracy:** Can the "wisdom of crowds" solve political problems?

## Common Misconceptions
- "Think for yourself." (Impossible. You can't verify the atomic weight of gold yourself. You have to trust the chemists.)
- "Truth is social." (Social Constructivism). Some things are socially constructed (money), but others aren't (gravity).

## Related Concepts
- **Groupthink:** When the desire for harmony leads to bad decisions.
- **Filter Bubbles:** Algorithms showing you only what you agree with.
- **Standpoint Epistemology:** The view that marginalized groups have special access to certain truths.

## Applications
- **Media Literacy:** Evaluating sources.
- **AI:** How to prevent bots from spreading misinformation.
- **Law:** Handling expert witnesses.

## Criticism / Limitations
Blind trust in authority is dangerous. We need a balance between trust and skepticism.
