## Overview
Ignorance is the lack of knowledge or information. Traditionally seen as a mere void, recent work (Agnotology) studies ignorance as a substantive phenomenon—something that is often actively constructed, maintained, or strategically used.

## Core Idea
The core idea is that ignorance is not just "not knowing"; it can be a tool of power, a result of secrecy, or a structural blind spot.

## Formal Definition
-   **Passive Ignorance:** Simply not knowing something.
-   **Active Ignorance:** The cultivation of doubt or confusion (e.g., by tobacco companies regarding cancer).
-   **Agnotology:** The study of culturally induced ignorance or doubt.

## Intuition
-   **The Blank Map:** Ancient maps had blank spaces ("Terra Incognita"). This is simple ignorance.
-   **The Smokescreen:** A company hides data about pollution. They are *creating* ignorance in the public to protect profits. This is active ignorance.

## Examples
-   **Tobacco Strategy:** "Doubt is our product." Tobacco companies funded research to create the impression that the link between smoking and cancer was still "controversial" long after it was settled.
-   **White Ignorance:** Charles Mills argues that racial privilege creates a structural blindness to the realities of racism.
-   **Privacy:** We deliberately keep others ignorant of our passwords or medical history (a positive use of ignorance).

## Common Misconceptions
-   **Misconception:** Ignorance is always bad.
    -   **Correction:** "Rational ignorance" (choosing not to learn trivial things) is efficient. Privacy is also a form of protected ignorance.
-   **Misconception:** Ignorance is just an absence.
    -   **Correction:** It is often a complex social achievement.

## Related Concepts
-   **Agnotology:** (See above).
-   **Epistemic Injustice:** Hermeneutical injustice is a form of structural ignorance.
-   **Skepticism:** Philosophical doubt is a form of cultivated ignorance (suspending judgment).

## Applications
-   **Public Policy:** Understanding how misinformation spreads and creates public ignorance.
-   **Organizational Management:** "Silos" in companies create pockets of ignorance.

## Criticism and Limitations
-   **Blame:** It is hard to distinguish between innocent ignorance (I didn't know) and culpable ignorance (I should have known).
-   **Paradox:** To study ignorance, we have to know what we don't know, which is tricky.
