## Overview
How do you know you aren't dreaming right now? How do you know the world wasn't created 5 minutes ago with false memories implanted in your head? Skepticism is the annoying friend who asks "But are you *sure*?"

## Core Idea
**Cartesian Skepticism:** Descartes tried to doubt everything to find one thing he couldn't doubt. He found "Cogito, ergo sum" (I think, therefore I am). Everything else (the external world, your body) could be an illusion.

## Formal Definition (if applicable)
**Brain in a Vat:** A thought experiment. If a mad scientist put your brain in a jar and stimulated it with electrodes to simulate reality, you wouldn't know the difference. Therefore, you can't know you *aren't* a brain in a vat.

## Intuition
Skepticism isn't about denying reality; it's about denying *knowledge* of reality. A skeptic looks both ways before crossing the street, but admits they can't prove the car is real.

## Examples
- **Pyrrhonian Skepticism:** Suspending judgment on everything to achieve peace of mind (ataraxia).
- **Academic Skepticism:** "I know that I know nothing" (Socrates).
- **Global Skepticism:** Doubting everything.
- **Local Skepticism:** Doubting specific things (e.g., moral skepticism, religious skepticism).

## Common Misconceptions
- "Skeptics don't believe in anything." (They just withhold assent.)
- "It's useless." (It forces us to sharpen our arguments and define what knowledge really is.)

## Related Concepts
- **Solipsism:** The view that only your own mind exists.
- **Fallibilism:** We can know things, but we can never be 100% certain.
- **Matrix Hypothesis:** Modern version of the Brain in a Vat.

## Applications
- **Science:** Organized skepticism is a core value. Always question the data.
- **Critical Thinking:** Don't believe everything you read.

## Criticism / Limitations
"Here is a hand." (G.E. Moore's common sense refutation). If skepticism leads to absurd conclusions, maybe the premises are wrong.
