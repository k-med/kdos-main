## Overview
You believe the sun will rise tomorrow. Why? Justification is the difference between a lucky guess and knowledge. It's the "because" in "I know X because..."

## Core Idea
**JTB Theory:** Knowledge = Justified True Belief. You need all three. (Gettier cases challenge this, but it's the starting point).

## Formal Definition (if applicable)
**Foundationalism:** The view that knowledge is like a building. It rests on a foundation of basic beliefs that don't need justification (e.g., "I exist" or "I am in pain"). All other beliefs are built on top.

## Intuition
- **Coherentism:** Knowledge is like a web. A belief is justified if it fits in with your other beliefs. (No foundation, just mutual support).
- **Reliabilism:** A belief is justified if it was produced by a reliable process (like good eyesight), even if you can't explain why.

## Examples
- **Internalism:** You must have access to the reasons for your belief (in your head).
- **Externalism:** The reasons can be outside your head (e.g., your brain is working correctly), as long as they are real.

## Common Misconceptions
- "Justification guarantees truth." (No, you can be justified in believing something false. E.g., You see a clock that says 12:00, so you believe it's 12:00. You are justified. But if the clock is broken, you are wrong.)

## Related Concepts
- **Evidentialism:** You should only believe what fits the evidence.
- **Skepticism:** The view that justification is impossible.
- **Epistemic Luck:** Getting the right answer for the wrong reason.

## Applications
- **Law:** "Beyond a reasonable doubt" is a standard of justification.
- **Science:** The Scientific Method is a machine for generating justification.
- **Religion:** Faith vs. Reason.

## Criticism / Limitations
The Munchhausen Trilemma: All justification leads to either 1) Infinite regress, 2) Circular reasoning, or 3) Arbitrary stopping point.
