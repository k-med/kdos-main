## Overview
Fallibilism is the epistemological principle that human beings could be wrong about their beliefs, expectations, or understanding of the world. It holds that absolute certainty is impossible for empirical knowledge.

## Core Idea
The core idea is intellectual humility: "I might be wrong." No matter how strong the evidence, there is always a theoretical possibility of error (e.g., new evidence, hallucination, paradigm shift).

## Formal Definition
Fallibilism is the doctrine that empirical knowledge can never be certain. It does not imply that we have *no* knowledge, but rather that knowledge does not require absolute certainty (infallibility).

## Intuition
-   **Newtonian Physics:** For centuries, it was considered absolutely true. Then Einstein came along and showed it was only an approximation. A fallibilist says, "Our current science is the best we have, but it might be corrected in the future."
-   **The Black Swan:** Europeans believed "All swans are white" for thousands of years until they went to Australia and saw black swans.

## Examples
-   **Science:** The scientific method is inherently fallibilist; every theory is provisional and subject to falsification.
-   **Jury Trials:** We convict "beyond a reasonable doubt," not "beyond all possible doubt," acknowledging the system is fallible.

## Common Misconceptions
-   **Misconception:** If we can be wrong, we don't know anything (Skepticism).
    -   **Correction:** Fallibilism is the middle ground between Dogmatism (we are certain) and Skepticism (we know nothing). It says we *do* know, but that knowledge is open to revision.
-   **Misconception:** Every opinion is equally valid.
    -   **Correction:** Just because we *might* be wrong doesn't mean we *are* wrong. Some beliefs are much better supported than others.

## Related Concepts
-   **Skepticism:** The doubt that knowledge is possible.
-   **Dogmatism:** The assertion of truth without doubt or sufficient evidence.
-   **Falsifiability:** Popper's criterion that a theory must be capable of being proven wrong to be scientific.

## Applications
-   **Scientific Inquiry:** Encourages constant testing and revision.
-   **Democracy:** Open debate is necessary because no single leader or party has the absolute truth.

## Criticism and Limitations
-   **Mathematics:** Is mathematical knowledge fallible? (Some say yes, most say no). Fallibilism is usually restricted to empirical knowledge.
-   **The "Fallibilist Paradox":** Is the belief "I am fallible" itself fallible? (If yes, maybe I'm actually infallible!).
