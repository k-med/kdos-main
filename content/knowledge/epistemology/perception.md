## Overview
We don't see the world as it is; we see it as *we* are. Perception is the interface between the mind and reality. But is it a window or a screen?

## Core Idea
**The Argument from Illusion:** A stick looks bent in water. It isn't bent. Therefore, what we see directly is not the real object, but a mental image ("sense-data").

## Formal Definition (if applicable)
**Naive Realism:** The view that we perceive the world directly. (What you see is what you get).
**Indirect Realism:** We perceive mental representations *of* the world. (Like watching a live video feed).

## Intuition
- **Primary Qualities:** Properties the object really has (Shape, Size, Motion).
- **Secondary Qualities:** Properties the object produces in us (Color, Taste, Smell). (The lemon isn't "sour"; sourness is in your mind).

## Examples
- **The Dress:** Blue/Black or White/Gold? (Perception is subjective).
- **Phantom Limb:** Feeling pain in a missing arm. (Perception without an object).
- **Change Blindness:** Failing to notice big changes in a scene.

## Common Misconceptions
- "Eyes are cameras." (The brain actively constructs the image, filling in the blind spot and stabilizing the shaky feed.)
- "Seeing is believing." (Magicians exploit the gaps in our perception.)

## Related Concepts
- **Qualia:** The raw "what it feels like" of experience (the redness of a rose).
- **Empiricism:** The view that all knowledge comes from perception.
- **Theory-Ladenness of Observation:** What you see depends on what you know. (An X-ray looks like a smudge to me, but a broken bone to a doctor).

## Applications
- **VR/AR:** Hacking perception to create new realities.
- **Design:** Using optical illusions to make rooms look bigger.
- **Law:** Eyewitness testimony is notoriously unreliable.

## Criticism / Limitations
If we only see mental images, how can we ever know the real world exists? (Veil of Perception).
