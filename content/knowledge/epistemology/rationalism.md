# Rationalism

## Overview
Rationalism is an epistemological view that regards reason as the chief source and test of knowledge. Rationalists believe that reality has an intrinsically logical structure and that certain truths exist that the intellect can grasp directly.

## Core Idea
The core idea is that there are significant ways in which our concepts and knowledge are gained independently of sense experience. Rationalists often argue for the existence of "innate ideas" or a priori knowledge.

## Formal Definition
Rationalism is the doctrine that at least some knowledge about reality can be acquired through pure reason, without the aid of sensory experience. It typically contrasts with empiricism.

## Intuition
Consider the statement "2 + 2 = 4" or "A triangle has three sides." You don't need to go out and count apples or measure shapes in the world to know these are true; you can understand their truth through logical reasoning alone.

## Examples
-   **Mathematics:** Mathematical truths are often cited as the prime example of rationalist knowledge—universal, necessary, and known a priori.
-   **Logic:** The laws of logic (e.g., the law of non-contradiction) are understood through reason.
-   **Descartes' "Cogito, ergo sum":** "I think, therefore I am" is a truth arrived at through introspection and reasoning, not external observation.

## Common Misconceptions
-   **Misconception:** Rationalists ignore sensory experience entirely.
    -   **Correction:** Rationalists acknowledge that sensory experience provides data, but they argue it is often unreliable or insufficient for certain types of certain knowledge.
-   **Misconception:** Rationalism is the same as "being rational" or reasonable.
    -   **Correction:** While related, philosophical rationalism is a specific stance on the *source* of knowledge, not just a general attitude of being logical.

## Related Concepts
-   **Empiricism:** The view that knowledge comes from sensory experience.
-   **A Priori Knowledge:** Knowledge that is independent of experience.
-   **Innate Ideas:** Concepts present in the mind at birth (e.g., God, infinity, perfection).

## Applications
-   **Theoretical Physics:** Often relies on mathematical models and reasoning before empirical confirmation.
-   **Computer Science:** Logic and algorithm design are fundamentally rationalist activities.
-   **Ethics:** Deontological ethics (like Kant's) often rely on rational derivation of duties.

## Criticism and Limitations
-   **Lack of Empirical Content:** Critics argue that pure reason can only tell us about the relations of ideas (like definitions), not about the actual state of the world.
-   **Dogmatism:** Relying solely on reason can lead to dogmatic assertions that clash with observed reality.
-   **Variability of "Reason":** What seems "rationally evident" to one person might not to another.
