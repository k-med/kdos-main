## Overview
In epistemology, memory is the faculty of the mind by which information is encoded, stored, and retrieved. The philosophical questions concern whether memory is a distinct source of knowledge (like perception) or merely a way of preserving knowledge acquired in the past.

## Core Idea
The core idea is that memory is our link to the past. Without it, we would be trapped in the immediate present, unable to learn or form a coherent identity.

## Formal Definition
Epistemologically, memory is often divided into:
1.  **Preservative Memory:** It preserves the justification a belief had when it was formed.
2.  **Generative Memory:** It can generate new justification (e.g., by re-evaluating past events).

## Intuition
You remember that you had coffee this morning. How do you know? You can't see the coffee now. You rely on a mental image or feeling of "pastness." But how do you know that feeling is reliable?

## Examples
-   **Semantic Memory:** Remembering facts (e.g., "Paris is the capital of France").
-   **Episodic Memory:** Remembering personal experiences (e.g., "I visited Paris in 2010").
-   **Procedural Memory:** Remembering how to do things (e.g., riding a bike), though this is less central to propositional knowledge.

## Common Misconceptions
-   **Misconception:** Memory is like a video recording that we just play back.
    -   **Correction:** Research shows memory is reconstructive. We rebuild memories every time we access them, often incorporating new information or errors.
-   **Misconception:** If I remember it clearly, it must have happened.
    -   **Correction:** "Flashbulb memories" (vivid memories of emotional events) can be highly inaccurate despite their clarity.

## Related Concepts
-   **The Problem of Forgotten Evidence:** If you remember a fact (e.g., "The Battle of Hastings was in 1066") but have forgotten *where* you learned it, are you still justified in believing it?
-   **Skepticism about the Past:** Bertrand Russell's hypothesis that the world could have come into existence five minutes ago with all our "memories" already implanted.

## Applications
-   **Eyewitness Testimony:** Understanding the fallibility of memory is crucial in criminal justice.
-   **History:** Historical knowledge relies on the collective memory of society (records, oral traditions).

## Criticism and Limitations
-   **Constructive Nature:** Since memory is reconstructive, it is prone to distortion, suggestion, and false memories.
-   **Circular Justification:** We use memory to justify the reliability of memory (e.g., "Memory has worked in the past"), which is circular.
