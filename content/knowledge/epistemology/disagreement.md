## Overview
The epistemology of disagreement asks: What should I do when I discover that an "epistemic peer" (someone just as smart and well-informed as I am) disagrees with me? Should I stick to my guns or lower my confidence?

## Core Idea
The core idea is that disagreement from a peer is a form of evidence—evidence that I might be wrong.

## Formal Definition
**Epistemic Peer Disagreement:** A situation where two agents, S1 and S2, are roughly equal in intelligence, reasoning ability, and access to evidence, yet S1 believes P and S2 believes not-P.

## Intuition
You and a friend calculate a tip at a restaurant. You get $20. Your friend gets $22. You are both good at math.
-   **Conciliationist:** "We should both suspend judgment and check again." (Split the difference).
-   **Steadfaster:** "I did the math carefully. I see clearly that it's $20. I'm sticking with it."

## Examples
-   **Politics:** Intelligent, informed people disagree about tax policy.
-   **Religion:** Intelligent, informed people disagree about the existence of God.
-   **Philosophy:** Philosophers disagree about almost everything!

## Common Misconceptions
-   **Misconception:** If people disagree, there is no truth.
    -   **Correction:** Disagreement is about *justification*, not truth. One person is right and the other is wrong (or both are wrong), but the question is what they should *believe* given the conflict.
-   **Misconception:** I can just assume the other person is biased.
    -   **Correction:** If they are a true "peer," you can't assume that without independent evidence.

## Related Concepts
-   **Conciliationism:** The view that you should adjust your confidence (move toward the peer).
-   **Steadfastness:** The view that you can reasonably maintain your belief despite peer disagreement.
-   **Uniqueness Thesis:** The idea that a body of evidence justifies only one specific attitude (belief, disbelief, or suspension).

## Applications
-   **Civil Discourse:** Understanding disagreement can promote intellectual humility and better dialogue.
-   **Expert Consensus:** When experts disagree (e.g., in climate science or economics), what should the layperson believe?

## Criticism and Limitations
-   **Spinelessness:** If Conciliationism is true, we might end up suspending judgment on everything controversial (politics, religion, philosophy), leading to intellectual paralysis.
-   **Self-Undermining:** Does the Conciliationist have to suspend judgment about Conciliationism itself (since many philosophers disagree with it)?
