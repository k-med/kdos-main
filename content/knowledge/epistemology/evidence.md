# Evidence

## Overview
Evidence is the information or data that supports a belief or proposition. In epistemology, it is the currency of justification. The central question is: What constitutes evidence, and how does it justify belief?

## Core Idea
The core idea is that beliefs should be proportioned to the evidence (Evidentialism). If you have good evidence, you are justified; if not, you aren't.

## Formal Definition
Evidence is that which confers justification on a belief. It is often characterized as:
1.  **Propositional:** Evidence consists of facts or propositions.
2.  **Mentalist:** Evidence consists of mental states (experiences).
3.  **Probabilistic:** Evidence E supports hypothesis H if E makes H more probable.

## Intuition
-   **The Detective:** A fingerprint on the gun is evidence that the suspect held the gun. It raises the probability of guilt.
-   **The Scientist:** Data from the telescope is evidence for the theory of black holes.

## Examples
-   **Sensory Evidence:** Seeing rain is evidence that it is raining.
-   **Testimonial Evidence:** A witness saying "I saw him" is evidence.
-   **Circumstantial Evidence:** Indirect evidence (e.g., motive and opportunity) that implies a fact.

## Common Misconceptions
-   **Misconception:** Evidence means "proof."
    -   **Correction:** Evidence comes in degrees. You can have weak evidence (a rumor) or strong evidence (DNA). Proof is the highest standard, usually reserved for math.
-   **Misconception:** Evidence speaks for itself.
    -   **Correction:** Evidence always requires interpretation within a framework.

## Related Concepts
-   **Evidentialism:** The view that justification depends entirely on evidence.
-   **Bayesianism:** A mathematical framework for updating beliefs based on new evidence.
-   **Underdetermination:** The idea that evidence can support multiple rival theories equally well.

## Applications
-   **Law:** The rules of evidence determine what can be presented in court.
-   **Medicine:** Evidence-Based Medicine (EBM) prioritizes clinical research over anecdote or tradition.

## Criticism and Limitations
-   **The Regress:** If evidence justifies belief, what justifies the evidence? (Leads to Foundationalism vs. Coherentism).
-   **Theory-Ladenness:** Observation is often influenced by the theory we hold (we see what we expect to see), complicating the neutrality of evidence.
