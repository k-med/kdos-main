## Overview
Epistemic injustice refers to a wrong done to someone specifically in their capacity as a knower. Coined by Miranda Fricker, it highlights how prejudice can harm people's ability to convey knowledge or make sense of their own experiences.

## Core Idea
The core idea is that social power dynamics affect how knowledge is produced and shared. When prejudice causes us to deflate a person's credibility or deny them the concepts to understand their experience, we commit an epistemic injustice.

## Formal Definition
Epistemic injustice consists of two main types:
1.  **Testimonial Injustice:** When prejudice causes a hearer to give a deflated level of credibility to a speaker's word (e.g., not believing a woman because of sexism).
2.  **Hermeneutical Injustice:** When a gap in collective interpretive resources puts someone at a disadvantage when trying to make sense of their social experiences (e.g., experiencing sexual harassment before the term existed).

## Intuition
-   **Testimonial:** Imagine a doctor ignoring a patient's description of pain because of the patient's race or gender, assuming they are exaggerating. The patient is wronged as a source of knowledge.
-   **Hermeneutical:** Imagine suffering from postpartum depression in an era where it is not understood, and being labeled simply as "hysterical" or a "bad mother." You lack the collective tools to understand your own suffering.

## Examples
-   **To Kill a Mockingbird:** The jury refuses to believe Tom Robinson's truthful testimony simply because he is Black. (Testimonial Injustice).
-   **"Sexual Harassment":** Before the 1970s, women experienced workplace harassment but had no name for it, making it difficult to report or even fully conceptualize as a systemic wrong. (Hermeneutical Injustice).

## Common Misconceptions
-   **Misconception:** It's just about being polite.
    -   **Correction:** It is a distinct *epistemic* harm; it degrades the person's status as a rational agent and prevents truth from being known.
-   **Misconception:** It only happens to minorities.
    -   **Correction:** While marginalized groups are disproportionately affected, it can happen to anyone against whom there is identity prejudice.

## Related Concepts
-   **Epistemic Violence:** A broader term for harm caused through knowledge practices (e.g., silencing).
-   **Standpoint Theory:** The idea that marginalized groups have a unique epistemic vantage point.
-   **Gaslighting:** Manipulating someone into doubting their own sanity or perception (a form of epistemic abuse).

## Applications
-   **Healthcare:** Addressing racial and gender bias in pain management and diagnosis.
-   **Law:** Ensuring fair assessment of witness credibility.
-   **Education:** Recognizing diverse forms of knowledge and expression in the classroom.

## Criticism and Limitations
-   **Scope:** Some argue the concept is too broad and risks labeling all misunderstandings as "injustice."
-   **Individual vs. Structural:** Debates continue over whether the primary remedy is individual virtue (listening better) or structural change.
