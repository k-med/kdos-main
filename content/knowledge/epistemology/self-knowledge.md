# Self-Knowledge

## Overview
Self-knowledge refers to knowledge of one's own mental states (beliefs, desires, sensations, emotions). It is often thought to be special because it is direct and authoritative in a way that knowledge of the external world or other minds is not.

## Core Idea
The core idea is "privileged access." I know I am in pain in a way that you cannot know I am in pain. I have a "first-person" perspective on my own mind.

## Formal Definition
Self-knowledge is knowledge of one's own current mental states. It is often characterized by:
1.  **Immediacy:** It is not inferred from evidence.
2.  **Authority:** The subject is the final arbiter.
3.  **Transparency:** To know if I believe P, I just ask myself whether P is true.

## Intuition
If you ask me, "Do you have a headache?", I don't need to look in a mirror or hook myself up to a machine. I just *feel* it. My knowledge seems immediate and certain.

## Examples
-   **Sensations:** "I feel cold."
-   **Beliefs:** "I believe it is going to rain."
-   **Intentions:** "I intend to go to the store."

## Common Misconceptions
-   **Misconception:** We know *everything* about our own minds (Cartesian Transparency).
    -   **Correction:** Freud and modern psychology show we have an unconscious mind and are often ignorant of our true motives or biases.
-   **Misconception:** Self-knowledge is infallible.
    -   **Correction:** We can be wrong (e.g., confusing fear with excitement, or thinking we believe something we actually don't).

## Related Concepts
-   **Introspection:** The process of "looking within" to examine one's thoughts.
-   **The Unconscious:** Mental states that are not accessible to consciousness.
-   **Moore's Paradox:** The absurdity of saying "It is raining, but I don't believe it." (It shows the tight link between asserting P and attributing the belief P to oneself).

## Applications
-   **Psychotherapy:** Helping patients gain self-knowledge about their hidden patterns and desires.
-   **Moral Responsibility:** We are often held responsible for our attitudes and intentions because we are presumed to know them.

## Criticism and Limitations
-   **Ryle's Behaviorism:** Gilbert Ryle argued that self-knowledge is not "looking within" a private theater, but observing our own behavior and dispositions, just like we observe others.
-   **Theory-Theory:** The view that we infer our mental states using a "theory of mind," just as we do for others, rather than having direct access.
