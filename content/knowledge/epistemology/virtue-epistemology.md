## Overview
Instead of asking "Is this belief justified?", Virtue Epistemology asks "Is this person a good thinker?" It focuses on intellectual character traits.

## Core Idea
**Intellectual Virtues:** Traits that help you get to the truth.
- **Curiosity:** Wanting to know.
- **Open-mindedness:** Willingness to consider other views.
- **Intellectual Humility:** Admitting when you are wrong.
- **Tenacity:** Not giving up on a hard problem.

## Formal Definition (if applicable)
**Intellectual Vices:** Traits that block knowledge.
- **Dogmatism:** Refusing to change your mind.
- **Gullibility:** Believing anything.
- **Intellectual Laziness:** Taking the easy answer.

## Intuition
A good detective isn't just someone who follows the rules of logic. They are someone who is observant, careful, and fair. Knowledge is an achievement of character.

## Examples
- **The Scientist:** Ideally embodies objectivity and skepticism.
- **The Conspiracy Theorist:** Often exhibits vices like closed-mindedness (to contrary evidence) and gullibility (to their own theory).

## Common Misconceptions
- "Virtues are just for saints." (They are skills we can all practice.)
- "It's just ethics." (It's about *epistemic* goods—truth and understanding—not just moral goods.)

## Related Concepts
- **Responsibilism:** Knowledge requires responsible agency.
- **Reliabilism:** Virtues are just reliable cognitive faculties (like good memory).
- **Wisdom:** The ultimate intellectual virtue (knowing how to live well).

## Applications
- **Education:** Teaching students to be curious, not just to pass tests.
- **Politics:** We need virtuous citizens who can evaluate arguments.
- **Internet:** Navigating fake news requires intellectual caution.

## Criticism / Limitations
"Situationism" in psychology suggests that character traits aren't stable. We might be open-minded at work but dogmatic at home.
