  Truth is the property of being in accord with fact or reality. In everyday language, truth is typically ascribed to things that aim to represent reality or otherwise correspond to it, such as beliefs, propositions, and declarative sentences.

## Overview
What is truth? (Pontius Pilate). It seems simple: "Snow is white" is true if snow is white. But philosophers have fought over this for 2,000 years.

## Core Idea
**Correspondence Theory:** A statement is true if it corresponds to a fact in the world. (The map matches the territory). This is the "common sense" view.

## Formal Definition (if applicable)
**Coherence Theory:** A statement is true if it fits coherently with a system of other beliefs. (Like a legal case—the story must hold together).

## Intuition
- **Pragmatic Theory:** Truth is what works. If believing "fire burns" keeps you alive, it's true. (William James).
- **Deflationism:** Saying "It is true that snow is white" adds nothing to saying "Snow is white." Truth is just a linguistic tool, not a deep metaphysical property.

## Examples
- **Scientific Truth:** Provisional, based on evidence.
- **Mathematical Truth:** Necessary, based on logic ($2+2=4$).
- **Moral Truth:** Subjective? Objective? (Big debate).

## Common Misconceptions
- "Truth is relative." (If "Truth is relative" is true, then it's an absolute truth, which is a contradiction. Most philosophers are realists about truth.)
- "My truth." (You can have your own *perspective* or *opinion*, but truth usually implies a shared reality.)

## Related Concepts
- **Liar Paradox:** "This sentence is false." (If it's true, it's false. If it's false, it's true.)
- **Verisimilitude:** Truth-likeness. Newton's physics isn't strictly true (Einstein proved it wrong), but it's *closer* to the truth than Aristotle's physics.

## Applications
- **Journalism:** Fact-checking.
- **Law:** Perjury (lying under oath).
- **Logic:** Truth tables.

## Criticism / Limitations
Correspondence theory struggles with negative facts ("There is no elephant in the room"—what fact does that correspond to?) and moral facts.
