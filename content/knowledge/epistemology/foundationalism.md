# Foundationalism

## Overview
Foundationalism is a theory of epistemic justification which posits that there are two types of beliefs: basic beliefs (which are self-justifying or justified non-inferentially) and non-basic beliefs (which derive their justification from basic beliefs).

## Core Idea
The core idea is that knowledge must have a solid foundation to avoid an infinite regress of justification. Like a building, the upper stories (derived beliefs) rest on a foundation (basic beliefs).

## Formal Definition
Foundationalism is the view that the structure of justified belief is such that all justified beliefs are either foundational (basic) or derived from foundational beliefs via a chain of justification.

## Intuition
If you ask "Why do you believe C?" and the answer is "Because of B," and then "Why B?" -> "Because of A." Eventually, you must reach a point where the answer is "I just see it" or "It is self-evident." You cannot keep asking "Why?" forever.

## Examples
-   **Descartes' Foundation:** "I think, therefore I am" was a foundational belief for Descartes—something that could not be doubted.
-   **Sensory Experience:** For many empiricist foundationalists, "I am in pain" or "I see red" are basic beliefs justified directly by experience.
-   **Axioms in Geometry:** Euclidean geometry is built on a set of axioms (foundations) from which theorems are derived.

## Common Misconceptions
-   **Misconception:** Foundations must be absolutely certain and infallible.
    -   **Correction:** "Modest foundationalism" allows that basic beliefs can be fallible (e.g., perceptual beliefs) but still provide a starting point.
-   **Misconception:** Foundationalism requires a very small number of basic beliefs.
    -   **Correction:** The set of basic beliefs can be quite large (e.g., all current perceptual beliefs).

## Related Concepts
-   **Coherentism:** The view that justification comes from the mutual support of beliefs, not a foundation.
-   **Infinite Regress:** The problem that arises if every belief requires another belief to justify it.
-   **Basic Beliefs:** Beliefs that do not depend on other beliefs for their justification.

## Applications
-   **Mathematics:** Axiomatic systems are foundationalist in structure.
-   **Computer Science:** Root of trust in security systems.
-   **Theology:** "Reformed Epistemology" argues that belief in God can be properly basic.

## Criticism and Limitations
-   **Arbitrariness:** Critics ask what makes a belief "basic." If there is a reason, it's not basic; if there isn't, it seems arbitrary.
-   **Sellars' Dilemma:** The "Myth of the Given"—attacking the idea that non-conceptual sensory input can justify conceptual beliefs.
-   **Fallibility:** If foundations can be wrong, the whole structure can collapse.
