## Overview
Empiricism is a fundamental theory in epistemology which asserts that knowledge comes primarily or solely from sensory experience. It emphasizes the role of empirical evidence in the formation of ideas, rather than innate ideas or traditions. Empiricism stands in contrast to rationalism, which emphasizes reason as the source of knowledge.

## Core Idea
The core idea of empiricism is that the mind is a "tabula rasa" (blank slate) at birth, and that all knowledge is acquired through experience. This experience can be external (sensation) or internal (reflection).

## Formal Definition
Empiricism is the epistemological doctrine that all concepts and beliefs are ultimately justifiable only by reference to experience. It denies the existence of a priori knowledge (knowledge independent of experience) for substantive truths about the world.

## Intuition
Imagine you want to know if it is raining outside. An empiricist would say you cannot know this by just thinking about it; you must go to the window and look (use your senses). Similarly, to know if fire is hot, you must experience heat.

## Examples
-   **Scientific Method:** Science relies heavily on empirical observation and experimentation to test hypotheses.
-   **Learning a Language:** Children learn language by listening to others and mimicking sounds, not by being born with a vocabulary.
-   **Cooking:** You learn how to cook by tasting and experimenting with ingredients, not just by reading a theory of flavor.

## Common Misconceptions
-   **Misconception:** Empiricists do not believe in logic or mathematics.
    -   **Correction:** Most empiricists accept logic and math but often view them as relations of ideas (tautologies) rather than substantive knowledge about the world, or argue that even these have empirical roots.
-   **Misconception:** Empiricism means only believing what you can see with your own eyes.
    -   **Correction:** It includes all sensory modalities and often extends to using instruments (like microscopes) that extend the senses.

## Related Concepts
-   **Rationalism:** The opposing view that reason is the chief source of knowledge.
-   **Tabula Rasa:** The "blank slate" theory of the mind associated with John Locke.
-   **Positivism:** A philosophy that holds that every rationally justifiable assertion can be scientifically verified.

## Applications
-   **Experimental Science:** The foundation of modern scientific inquiry.
-   **Medicine:** Evidence-based medicine relies on clinical trials and observational studies.
-   **Psychology:** Behaviorism was a strongly empiricist movement in psychology.

## Criticism and Limitations
-   **Problem of Induction:** David Hume pointed out that we cannot logically justify the assumption that the future will resemble the past based solely on past experience.
-   **Abstract Concepts:** It is difficult to explain how we acquire abstract concepts (like "justice" or "infinity") purely through sensory experience.
-   **Perceptual Illusion:** Senses can be deceived (e.g., optical illusions), raising questions about their reliability as the sole source of truth.
