## Overview
Tacit knowledge (or implicit knowledge) is knowledge that is difficult to transfer to another person by means of writing it down or verbalizing it. It is the "know-how" that lives in our bodies and habits.

## Core Idea
The core idea is "we can know more than we can tell" (Michael Polanyi).

## Formal Definition
Tacit knowledge is knowledge that is not codified or explicit. It is often acquired through personal experience and practice.
-   **Explicit Knowledge:** Can be written in a manual (e.g., a recipe).
-   **Tacit Knowledge:** The skill required to *execute* the recipe perfectly (e.g., kneading dough).

## Intuition
-   **Riding a Bike:** You know how to ride a bike. But can you write a manual that would enable someone who has never ridden one to immediately ride perfectly? No. They have to learn by doing. Your knowledge is tacit.
-   **Recognizing a Face:** You know your mother's face instantly. But try describing it so precisely that a stranger could pick her out of a crowd of similar people. It's very hard.

## Examples
-   **Language:** Native speakers know the grammar rules tacitly; linguists make them explicit.
-   **Craftsmanship:** A master carpenter has a "feel" for the wood that cannot be fully explained in words.
-   **Scientific Intuition:** Experienced scientists have a "nose" for good problems that isn't in the textbook.

## Common Misconceptions
-   **Misconception:** Tacit knowledge is just "unconscious."
    -   **Correction:** It is often conscious in the sense that we are aware of doing it, but we cannot *articulate* the rules we are following.
-   **Misconception:** It can never be shared.
    -   **Correction:** It can be shared through apprenticeship, imitation, and socialization, just not easily through text.

## Related Concepts
-   **Know-How vs. Know-That:** Ryle's distinction between practical skill and propositional knowledge.
-   **Procedural Memory:** The psychological term for memory of skills.
-   **Expert Systems:** AI attempts to capture the tacit knowledge of experts (often difficult).

## Applications
-   **Knowledge Management:** Companies try to capture the tacit knowledge of retiring experts.
-   **Education:** Apprenticeships and internships are designed to transfer tacit knowledge.

## Criticism and Limitations
-   **Ineffability:** Because it can't be spoken, it's hard to analyze or critique.
-   **Elitism:** It can be used to exclude outsiders ("You just don't have the 'feel' for it").
