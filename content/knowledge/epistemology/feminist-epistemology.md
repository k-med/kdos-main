## Overview
Feminist epistemology is an approach that examines how gender and gendered power relations influence the production, validation, and distribution of knowledge. It challenges the traditional ideal of the "generic," objective knower.

## Core Idea
The core idea is that the social location of the knower (including their gender, race, and class) affects what they know and how they know it. Traditional epistemology often falsely assumes a "view from nowhere" that implicitly centers male perspectives.

## Formal Definition
Feminist epistemology studies the ways in which gender influences our concept of knowledge and practices of inquiry. It identifies ways in which dominant conceptions of knowledge systematically disadvantage women and other subordinated groups.

## Intuition
-   **Medical Research:** For decades, heart attack symptoms were defined based on male physiology. Women's symptoms were different and often misdiagnosed. This wasn't just "bad science"; it was a structural failure to consider women as knowers and subjects of knowledge.
-   **"Women's Intuition":** Often dismissed as irrational, whereas similar insights in men might be called "instinct" or "experience."

## Examples
-   **Standpoint Theory:** The view that marginalized groups (like women) have a privileged epistemic standpoint for understanding social hierarchies because they experience them directly.
-   **Critique of Objectivity:** Arguing that "objectivity" often masks the subjective bias of the dominant group.
-   **Situated Knowledge:** The idea that all knowledge is "situated" in a specific context and body.

## Common Misconceptions
-   **Misconception:** It says there is "male math" and "female math."
    -   **Correction:** It rarely attacks formal logic itself, but rather the *practices* and *metaphors* surrounding it (e.g., associating reason with maleness and emotion with femaleness).
-   **Misconception:** It rejects truth.
    -   **Correction:** Most feminist epistemologists want *better*, more accurate truth that includes the perspectives of half the human race.

## Related Concepts
-   **Epistemic Injustice:** (See separate topic).
-   **Strong Objectivity:** Harding's concept that starting research from the lives of the marginalized produces *more* objective accounts.
-   **Intersectionality:** Considering how gender overlaps with race, class, etc.

## Applications
-   **Science Studies:** Analyzing gender bias in biology and primatology.
-   **Social Policy:** Ensuring policies reflect the lived experiences of all genders.

## Criticism and Limitations
-   **Relativism:** Critics argue that emphasizing social location leads to relativism (my truth vs. your truth).
-   **Essentialism:** Risk of assuming all women share the same "standpoint" or experience.
