## Overview
Objectivity is the quality of being true independently of individual subjectivity, bias, or interpretation. In epistemology, it is the ideal of seeing the world "as it really is," rather than how we wish or fear it to be.

## Core Idea
The core idea is the "View from Nowhere" (Thomas Nagel). To be objective is to step outside your personal perspective and see facts that are valid for everyone.

## Formal Definition
Objectivity typically involves:
1.  **Ontological Objectivity:** Things exist independently of the mind.
2.  **Epistemic Objectivity:** Methods of inquiry are free from personal bias and values.

## Intuition
-   **Referee:** A sports referee is supposed to be objective. They shouldn't care who wins; they should just apply the rules to the facts.
-   **Thermometer:** A thermometer is objective. It doesn't care if you feel cold or hot; it just registers the temperature.

## Examples
-   **Journalism:** The ideal of reporting "just the facts" without editorializing.
-   **Scientific Method:** Designed to eliminate human bias through double-blind studies and peer review.
-   **Justice:** The symbol of Justice is blindfolded to represent objectivity (impartiality).

## Common Misconceptions
-   **Misconception:** Objectivity is easy; just don't be emotional.
    -   **Correction:** Cognitive psychology shows we are riddled with unconscious biases that make true objectivity extremely difficult.
-   **Misconception:** Objectivity means having no opinion.
    -   **Correction:** It means basing your opinion on neutral evidence, not lack of conviction.

## Related Concepts
-   **Subjectivity:** The quality of being based on personal feelings or opinions.
-   **Intersubjectivity:** Agreement between different subjects (a more achievable standard than pure objectivity).
-   **Bias:** The deviation from objectivity.

## Applications
-   **Science:** The gold standard for objective inquiry.
-   **Law:** Judges and juries must be objective.
-   **Media:** The debate over whether "objective journalism" is possible or even desirable.

## Criticism and Limitations
-   **Feminist Critique:** (See Feminist Epistemology). Objectivity can be a mask for the dominant male perspective.
-   **Postmodern Critique:** There is no "view from nowhere"; everyone is situated.
-   **Value-Free Ideal:** Many argue science *cannot* be value-free (e.g., choosing what to study is a value judgment).
