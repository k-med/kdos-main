# KDOS Domain Taxonomy v1.0

## Core principles (read once)

1. **Domains are “what kind of knowledge this is”**, not what it’s about.
    
2. Domains change _slowly_; tags change _freely_.
    
3. Every entry should have **1–3 domains**, never more.
    
4. If unsure between two domains:
    
    - Ask: _which discipline would teach this?_

## Explicit exclusions (important)

These are **NOT domains** — they are tags:

- AI
    
- Machine learning
    
- Stoicism
    
- Trading
    
- Programming languages
    
- Tools
    
- Techniques
