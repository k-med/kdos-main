## Overview
**Oncology** is the study and treatment of cancer. Cancer is not one disease but hundreds, all sharing a common feature: uncontrolled cell growth.

## Core Idea
The core idea is **rebellion**. A cancer cell is a normal cell that has stopped following the rules. It divides when it shouldn't, refuses to die when it should (apoptosis), and invades territories where it doesn't belong (metastasis).

## Formal Definition
A branch of medicine that deals with the prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of cancer. A medical professional who practices oncology is an oncologist.

## Intuition
Cancer is **evolution gone wrong** inside the body. Cancer cells evolve to survive the body's defenses and treatments. Treating it is like fighting a guerrilla war against your own cells.

## Examples
-   **Carcinoma:** Cancer starting in the skin or tissue lining organs (e.g., lung, breast).
-   **Leukemia:** Cancer of the blood-forming tissues (bone marrow).
-   **Chemotherapy:** Using toxic drugs to kill rapidly dividing cells.
-   **Radiation Therapy:** Using high-energy beams to damage DNA and kill cancer cells.

## Common Misconceptions
-   **Misconception:** We will find "The Cure" for cancer.
    -   **Correction:** Because cancer is hundreds of different diseases with different genetic causes, there will likely be hundreds of different cures, not one magic bullet.
-   **Misconception:** Cancer is a modern disease.
    -   **Correction:** It has existed as long as multicellular life, but we see more of it now because people live longer (age is the biggest risk factor).

## Related Concepts
-   **[Genetics](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/biology/genetics.md):** Cancer is fundamentally a genetic disease (mutations).
-   **[Metastasis](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/medicine/metastasis.md):** The spread of cancer cells to new areas of the body.
-   **[Palliative Care](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/medicine/palliative-care.md):** Care focused on relief from symptoms and stress, rather than cure.

## Applications
-   **Screening:** Pap smears, colonoscopies, and mammograms save lives by catching cancer early.
-   **Precision Medicine:** Sequencing a tumor's DNA to choose the exact drug that targets its specific mutations.

## Criticism and Limitations
-   **Toxicity:** Traditional treatments (chemo/radiation) harm healthy cells too, causing severe side effects.
-   **Cost:** New cancer drugs are among the most expensive medicines in the world.
