## Overview
**Anatomy** is the study of structure. It maps the geography of the body—bones, muscles, organs, nerves, and vessels. It answers the question: "What is it and where is it?"

## Core Idea
The core idea is **form follows function**. The shape and structure of a body part are directly related to what it does. The heart is a pump, so it has chambers and valves.

## Formal Definition
The scientific study of the structure of organisms including their systems, organs, and tissues. It includes:
-   **Gross Anatomy:** Structures visible to the naked eye.
-   **Microscopic Anatomy (Histology):** Structures requiring a microscope (cells, tissues).

## Intuition
Anatomy is the **blueprint** of the machine. Before a mechanic can fix a car, they need to know where the carburetor is and how it connects to the engine. Before a surgeon cuts, they must know exactly what lies beneath the skin.

## Examples
-   **Skeletal System:** The framework of bones that supports the body.
-   **Circulatory System:** The network of arteries and veins transporting blood.
-   **Nervous System:** The wiring (nerves) and processor (brain) controlling the body.

## Common Misconceptions
-   **Misconception:** We know everything about anatomy.
    -   **Correction:** While gross anatomy is well-mapped, new discoveries are still made (e.g., the interstitium, new ligaments).
-   **Misconception:** It's static.
    -   **Correction:** Anatomy varies between individuals (anatomical variation) and changes with age.

## Related Concepts
-   **[Physiology](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/biology/physiology.md):** The study of how the parts *work*. Anatomy and physiology are inseparable.
-   **[Dissection](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/medicine/dissection.md):** The cutting apart of a body to study its structure.
-   **[Evolutionary Biology](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/biology/evolutionary-biology.md):** Explains *why* we have the anatomy we do (vestigial structures).

## Applications
-   **Surgery:** The absolute foundation of surgical practice.
-   **Art:** Artists study anatomy to draw the human form realistically.
-   **Forensics:** Identifying remains and determining cause of death.

## Criticism and Limitations
-   **Memorization:** Often taught as rote memorization of Latin names, which can obscure the functional beauty of the systems.
