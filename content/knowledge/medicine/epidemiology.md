## Overview
**Epidemiology** is the "detective work" of public health. It studies how often diseases occur in different groups of people and why. It is the foundation for disease control and prevention.

## Core Idea
The core idea is **patterns in populations**. Diseases don't strike randomly; they follow patterns based on geography, age, behavior, and environment. Finding these patterns reveals the cause.

## Formal Definition
The study of the **distribution** (frequency, pattern) and **determinants** (causes, risk factors) of health-related states or events in specified populations, and the application of this study to the control of health problems.

## Intuition
A doctor treats a patient. An epidemiologist treats a community.
-   Doctor: "You have cholera."
-   Epidemiologist: "Why do 50 people on this specific street have cholera?" (John Snow's famous investigation of the Broad Street Pump).

## Examples
-   **Outbreak Investigation:** Tracking Patient Zero in a viral pandemic (like COVID-19 or Ebola).
-   **Risk Factors:** Identifying that smoking causes lung cancer (Doll and Hill studies).
-   **Incidence vs. Prevalence:**
    -   *Incidence:* New cases per year.
    -   *Prevalence:* Total existing cases at a specific time.

## Common Misconceptions
-   **Misconception:** It's just about infectious diseases.
    -   **Correction:** It also studies chronic diseases (heart disease, diabetes), injuries, and social problems (opioid epidemic).
-   **Misconception:** Correlation equals causation.
    -   **Correction:** A major part of epidemiology is distinguishing between mere association and actual cause (using Bradford Hill criteria).

## Related Concepts
-   **[Public Health](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/medicine/public-health.md):** The science of protecting and improving the health of people and their communities.
-   **[Biostatistics](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/statistics/biostatistics.md):** The application of statistics to biological and medical data.
-   **[Pandemic](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/medicine/pandemic.md):** An epidemic occurring worldwide, or over a very wide area, crossing international boundaries.

## Applications
-   **Policy:** Deciding on lockdowns, vaccination mandates, or seatbelt laws.
-   **Prevention:** Designing campaigns to stop smoking or encourage exercise.

## Criticism and Limitations
-   **Confounding Variables:** It's hard to isolate one cause in a complex world (e.g., does coffee cause cancer, or do coffee drinkers just smoke more?).
-   **Recall Bias:** People often forget what they ate or did in the past.
