## Overview
**Neurology** is the study and treatment of disorders of the nervous system: the brain, spinal cord, and nerves. It deals with the body's electrical wiring and its central processor.

## Core Idea
The core idea is **localization**. Because different parts of the brain control different functions, a neurologist can often pinpoint exactly where a lesion is just by observing what the patient *can't* do (e.g., can't speak = left frontal lobe).

## Formal Definition
The medical specialty dealing with the diagnosis and treatment of all categories of conditions and disease involving the central and peripheral nervous systems.

## Intuition
The brain is the **seat of the self**. Neurology is where biology meets consciousness. It deals with movement, sensation, thought, memory, and emotion.

## Examples
-   **Stroke:** A blockage or bleed in the brain's blood supply, causing rapid loss of function.
-   **Alzheimer's Disease:** A neurodegenerative disease causing memory loss and cognitive decline.
-   **Epilepsy:** A disorder characterized by abnormal electrical activity in the brain (seizures).

## Common Misconceptions
-   **Misconception:** We only use 10% of our brains.
    -   **Correction:** Myth. We use all of our brain, just not all at once.
-   **Misconception:** Brain damage is always permanent.
    -   **Correction:** **Neuroplasticity** allows the brain to rewire itself and recover function, especially after injury.

## Related Concepts
-   **[Neuroscience](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/biology/neuroscience.md):** The scientific study of the nervous system (broader than just medicine).
-   **[Psychiatry](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/medicine/psychiatry.md):** Focuses on mental disorders and behavior, often with a chemical/psychological focus, while neurology focuses on structural/physical disease.
-   **[Neuron](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/biology/neuron.md):** The fundamental unit of the brain and nervous system.

## Applications
-   **Rehabilitation:** Helping stroke victims relearn to walk and talk.
-   **Pain Management:** Treating chronic pain conditions.

## Criticism and Limitations
-   **"Diagnose and Adios":** Historically, neurology was good at naming diseases but bad at curing them. This is changing with new treatments for stroke and MS, but neurodegenerative diseases remain largely incurable.
