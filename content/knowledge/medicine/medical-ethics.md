## Overview
**Medical Ethics** (or Bioethics) deals with the moral dilemmas that arise in the practice of medicine. It provides the framework for making difficult decisions about life, death, and treatment.

## Core Idea
The core idea is **balancing values**. Medicine isn't just about what we *can* do (science), but what we *should* do (ethics).

## Formal Definition
A system of moral principles that apply values to the practice of clinical medicine. The four pillars are:
1.  **Autonomy:** Respecting the patient's right to choose.
2.  **Beneficence:** Acting in the patient's best interest.
3.  **Non-maleficence:** "First, do no harm."
4.  **Justice:** Treating patients fairly and distributing resources equitably.

## Intuition
It's the **moral compass** of medicine.
-   Can a doctor force a Jehovah's Witness to have a life-saving blood transfusion? (Autonomy says no).
-   Who gets the one available kidney? (Justice).
-   When should we turn off the ventilator? (Beneficence/Non-maleficence).

## Examples
-   **Informed Consent:** Patients must understand the risks and benefits before agreeing to treatment.
-   **Euthanasia/Assisted Suicide:** The debate over whether doctors should help suffering patients end their lives.
-   **Confidentiality:** The duty to keep patient secrets (HIPAA).

## Common Misconceptions
-   **Misconception:** Doctors swear the Hippocratic Oath.
    -   **Correction:** Most do, but it's symbolic. Modern ethics relies on legal and professional standards, not just an ancient Greek text.
-   **Misconception:** "Do no harm" means never causing pain.
    -   **Correction:** Surgery causes pain (harm) to achieve a greater good (cure). The goal is net benefit.

## Related Concepts
-   **[Utilitarianism](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/ethics/utilitarianism.md):** The greatest good for the greatest number (often used in triage).
-   **[Deontology](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/ethics/deontology.md):** Duty-based ethics (following rules regardless of consequences).
-   **[Paternalism](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/medicine/paternalism.md):** The old model where the doctor decided what was best without consulting the patient (now rejected).

## Applications
-   **Research:** Ensuring human trials are ethical (Nuremberg Code).
-   **Resource Allocation:** Deciding who gets ICU beds during a pandemic.

## Criticism and Limitations
-   **Cultural Relativism:** Ethical standards vary by culture (e.g., role of family in decision making).
-   **Ambiguity:** Principles often conflict (Autonomy vs. Beneficence), and there is no algorithm to resolve them.
