## Overview
Often called the "fifth subfield," applied anthropology takes the insights of the discipline out of the academy and into the real world. It works in areas like business, government, healthcare, and non-profits.

## Core Idea
The goal is not just to study the world, but to change it (or help it work better). Applied anthropologists act as cultural brokers, translating between different groups (e.g., a corporation and a local community).

## Formal Definition (if applicable)
**Cultural Resource Management (CRM):** A branch of applied archaeology involved in the preservation and management of archaeological sites, often in the face of development projects.

## Intuition
If a company wants to sell shampoo in India, they need to understand local hair care practices. If a government wants to build a dam, they need to understand the impact on displaced communities. Anthropologists provide this context.

## Examples
- **Corporate Anthropology:** Intel and Microsoft hire anthropologists to study how people use technology.
- **Forensic Anthropology:** Identifying victims of war crimes for human rights organizations.
- **Development Anthropology:** Ensuring aid projects (like wells or schools) are sustainable and culturally appropriate.

## Common Misconceptions
- "Anthropologists only work in universities." (More than half work outside academia.)
- "It's selling out." (Applied anthropologists argue that using their skills to solve problems is an ethical imperative.)

## Related Concepts
- **Advocacy Anthropology:** Actively supporting the rights of the community being studied.
- **Public Anthropology:** Engaging the public in anthropological issues.
- **Action Research:** Research designed to solve a specific problem in collaboration with the community.

## Applications
- **Marketing:** Consumer research.
- **Design:** User experience (UX) research.
- **Policy:** Advising on immigration, education, or health policy.

## Criticism / Limitations
Applied work can raise ethical conflicts. Who owns the data? Is the anthropologist serving the community or the client paying the bill?
