  A Gift Economy is a mode of exchange where valuables are not traded or sold, but given without an explicit agreement for immediate or future rewards. However, social norms create a powerful obligation to reciprocate, building relationships and status.

## Overview
In a market economy (capitalism), we exchange goods for money. The transaction is impersonal and ends once the money changes hands. In a **Gift Economy**, goods are given. But as Marcel Mauss famously argued in *The Gift* (1925), there is no such thing as a "free gift." The gift creates a debt. It creates a social bond. The receiver is obligated to receive and obligated to give back later.

## Core Idea
The core idea is **reciprocity**. The gift is the glue of society. By giving, receiving, and returning gifts, people create a web of mutual obligation that holds the community together. In a gift economy, wealth is not about *hoarding* (having the most stuff), but about *circulation* (giving the most away). Status comes from generosity.

## Formal Definition
It is a system of exchange where goods and services are transferred without an explicit agreement for immediate or future quid pro quo. It is governed by three obligations: the obligation to give, the obligation to receive, and the obligation to reciprocate.

## Intuition
Think of buying a coffee vs. buying a round of drinks for friends.
-   **Market:** You pay the barista $5. You get coffee. You owe each other nothing. The relationship is zero.
-   **Gift:** You buy a round for your friends. They don't pay you back immediately. But now they "owe" you. Next time, someone else buys. If someone *never* buys a round, they lose social status (they are a "mooch"). The circulation of drinks builds the friendship.

## Examples
-   **The Kula Ring:** A ceremonial exchange system in the Trobriand Islands where red shell necklaces travel clockwise and white shell armbands travel counter-clockwise between islands. They are not "money"—they are history and prestige.
-   **The Potlatch:** A feast practiced by Indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast where leaders give away or destroy massive amounts of wealth (blankets, food, copper) to demonstrate their power and humiliate rivals.
-   **Open Source Software:** Linux or Wikipedia are modern gift economies. Programmers contribute code for free. They gain reputation and community status, not direct payment.
-   **Academia:** Peer review is a gift economy. Professors review papers for free to maintain the "community of science."

## Common Misconceptions
-   **It's altruistic:** It is rarely pure kindness. It is often competitive (fighting with property) and strategic. The gift can be a weapon to assert dominance (if you give me a gift I can't repay, I am in your debt).
-   **It's only for "primitive" societies:** We live in gift economies every day—within families, among friends, at Christmas, at weddings.

## Related Concepts
-   **Commodity:** An object produced for exchange in a market, stripped of social relations. The opposite of a gift.
-   **Social Capital:** The value of your relationships. Gift economies build social capital.
-   **Generalized Reciprocity:** Giving without expecting a return from the specific person (e.g., parents feeding children), trusting the system will provide later.

## Applications
-   **Digital Economy:** The internet (file sharing, content creation) often operates on gift economy principles ("Information wants to be free").
-   **Charity:** Understanding that charity can humiliate the receiver if they cannot reciprocate (the "poison of the gift") is crucial for effective aid.

## Criticism / Limitations
-   **Inefficiency:** Gift economies are terrible at distributing resources efficiently on a large scale compared to markets.
-   **Exclusion:** They rely on tight-knit communities. If you are an outsider, you are excluded from the network of reciprocity.
