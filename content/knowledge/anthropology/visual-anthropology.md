## Overview
"A picture is worth a thousand words." Visual Anthropology takes this seriously. Instead of just writing about a ritual, why not film it? But it's not just about making movies. It's about analyzing *how* we see. It critiques the "colonial gaze" (how Westerners photographed "natives") and explores how people use cameras to represent themselves.

## Core Idea
The core idea is **representation**. A photo is never neutral. The photographer chooses what to frame and what to leave out. Visual anthropology deconstructs these choices. It also argues that some cultural knowledge (like dance or gesture) is non-verbal and can *only* be captured visually.

## Formal Definition
The subfield concerned with the study and production of ethnographic photography, film, and, since the mid-1990s, new media. It encompasses the anthropological study of visual representation, including areas such as performance, museums, art, and the production and reception of mass media.

## Intuition
Watch a National Geographic documentary. Is it "true"? Or is it a dramatic story edited for entertainment? Does the dramatic music change how you feel about the lion hunt? Visual anthropology asks these questions. It tries to make films that are scientifically rigorous and culturally sensitive, often involving the subjects in the filmmaking process ("collaborative cinema").

## Examples
-   **Nanook of the North (1922):** The first ethnographic film. Robert Flaherty filmed the Inuit. It is beautiful, but also staged (he made them use spears instead of guns). It is a mix of fact and fiction.
-   **The Ax Fight (1975):** A famous film by Timothy Asch about the Yanomami. It shows a chaotic fight, then replays it with diagrams explaining the kinship ties, showing how visual chaos has a social structure.
-   **Indigenous Media:** Giving cameras to indigenous people (e.g., the Kayapo in Brazil) so they can document their own culture and fight for their land rights.

## Common Misconceptions
-   **It's just filmmaking:** It is research. The film is the data. The editing is the analysis.
-   **The camera never lies:** The camera *always* lies (or at least, selects). Visual anthropology is about being honest about that selection (reflexivity).

## Related Concepts
-   **The Gaze:** Foucault/Sartre's concept of how looking at someone gives you power over them. The "Male Gaze" or "Imperial Gaze."
-   **Sensory Ethnography:** A movement (e.g., Harvard's Sensory Ethnography Lab) that uses film to capture the raw sensory experience of a place (sound, texture) rather than explaining it with voiceover.
-   **Photo-Elicitation:** A method where you show photos to interviewees to trigger memories or discussion.

## Applications
-   **Museums:** Designing exhibitions that are visually engaging but not stereotypical.
-   **Media Studies:** Analyzing how TV and movies shape our cultural values.
-   **Advocacy:** Using video evidence to document human rights abuses.

## Criticism / Limitations
-   **Aesthetics vs. Science:** Is it art or is it science? Sometimes a film is too "arty" to be useful data, or too "dry" to be watchable.
-   **Privacy:** Filming people is more intrusive than writing notes. Consent is a huge ethical issue.
