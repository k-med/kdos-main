  Material Culture is the study of objects—tools, art, buildings, clothes—and how people use them to create social relations and meaning. It argues that "things" are not just inert matter; they are active players in our lives.

## Overview
We live in a world of things. We sleep in beds, wear clothes, drive cars, and tap on phones. Anthropology used to ignore these things to focus on "ideas" or "social structures." Material Culture studies bring the things back. It asks: How does a specific type of pot reflect a whole worldview? How does your choice of sneakers define your identity?

## Core Idea
The core idea is **objectification**. We project our values into objects, and then those objects shape us back. A house is not just a shelter; it is a physical map of family relations (who sleeps where?). A smartphone is not just a tool; it is an external brain. We make things, and things make us.

## Formal Definition
The study of the physical evidence of a culture in the objects and architecture they make, or have made. It bridges the gap between archaeology (which only has things) and social anthropology (which has people).

## Intuition
Look at your living room. The photos on the mantle, the books on the shelf, the worn-out chair. These aren't random. They tell a story about who you are, who you love, and what class you belong to. If an archaeologist dug up your room in 1,000 years, they could reconstruct your life just from the stuff. That is material culture.

## Examples
-   **The Social Life of Things:** Arjun Appadurai's concept that things have "biographies." A diamond starts as a rock, becomes a commodity in a mine, becomes a gift in a ring, and becomes an heirloom in a will. Its meaning changes as it moves.
-   **Blue Jeans:** Daniel Miller studied how people in London wear jeans. He found that jeans are a way to be "ordinary"—to fit in and avoid anxiety. They are a "comfort object" for the modern soul.
-   **Kula Valuables:** The shell necklaces in the Trobriand Islands are useless (you can't eat them), but they are the most valuable things in the culture because they carry the history of everyone who owned them.

## Common Misconceptions
-   **It's materialism:** "Materialism" usually means loving money. "Material Culture" means understanding that *all* culture (even religion) is mediated through matter (statues, incense, books).
-   **It's trivial:** Studying Tupperware or Barbie dolls seems silly, but these objects reveal deep truths about gender, domesticity, and capitalism.

## Related Concepts
-   **Agency of Objects:** The idea (from Alfred Gell) that objects can "act." A landmine has agency (it kills). An idol has agency (it demands worship).
-   **Consumption:** How we buy and use goods. In modern society, consumption is a primary way we construct our identity ("I shop, therefore I am").
-   **Entanglement:** Ian Hodder's theory that humans and things are trapped in a web of mutual dependence. We need things to survive, but things need us to fix them.

## Applications
-   **Design Anthropology:** Helping companies design better products by understanding how people actually use things in their homes.
-   **Museums:** The practical application of material culture theory—how to display objects to tell a story.

## Criticism / Limitations
-   **Fetishism:** There is a risk of focusing so much on the object that you forget the human labor that made it (Marx's critique).
-   **Over-interpretation:** Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar. Not every object has a deep symbolic meaning.
