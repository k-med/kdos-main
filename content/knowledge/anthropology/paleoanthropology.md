  Paleoanthropology is the study of human origins and evolution. It combines the disciplines of paleontology and physical anthropology to investigate the fossil record of hominins—the lineage of humans and our extinct ancestors.

## Overview
Where do we come from? Paleoanthropology answers this question not with myths, but with fossils. It traces the 6-7 million year journey from the last common ancestor we shared with chimpanzees to the emergence of modern *Homo sapiens*. It is a detective story where the clues are teeth, skull fragments, and stone tools found in the dirt of Africa and Eurasia.

## Core Idea
The core idea is **evolutionary mosaic**. We didn't become human all at once. Different traits evolved at different times. **Bipedalism** (walking on two legs) came first, millions of years before big brains. Tool use, language, and art followed later. We are a patchwork of ancient adaptations.

## Formal Definition
The branch of anthropology concerned with the fossil hominids (the family *Hominidae*, which includes humans and our ancestors). It relies on stratigraphy (dating layers of rock), comparative anatomy, and genetics.

## Intuition
Imagine a family tree. You are at the top. Your parents are below, then grandparents. Now keep going back 300,000 generations. You will meet "Lucy" (*Australopithecus afarensis*). She looks like an ape, stands about 3 feet tall, but she walks upright like you. She is your grandmother. Paleoanthropology introduces you to these lost relatives.

## Examples
-   **Lucy (AL 288-1):** The famous 3.2 million-year-old skeleton found in Ethiopia in 1974. She proved that our ancestors walked upright long before their brains got big.
-   **Homo erectus:** The first human ancestor to leave Africa, control fire, and have body proportions like ours. They lived for nearly 2 million years (much longer than us!).
-   **Neanderthals:** Our stocky, cold-adapted cousins in Europe. We used to think they were dumb brutes; now we know they made art, buried their dead, and even interbred with us (most non-Africans have 1-2% Neanderthal DNA).

## Common Misconceptions
-   **"The Missing Link":** There is no single "link." Evolution is a bushy tree with many dead ends, not a straight line from monkey to man.
-   **We evolved from chimps:** We share a *common ancestor* with chimps. We are cousins, not descendants.

## Related Concepts
-   **Bipedalism:** The defining trait of the hominin line. It freed our hands to carry tools and babies.
-   **Encephalization:** The evolutionary increase in the complexity or relative size of the brain.
-   **Out of Africa:** The theory that modern humans evolved in Africa about 300,000 years ago and then spread around the world, replacing other hominin species.

## Applications
-   **Medicine:** "Evolutionary Medicine" uses our deep history to understand modern diseases (e.g., back pain is a side effect of bipedalism; obesity is a mismatch between our stone-age metabolism and modern diets).
-   **Philosophy:** Understanding that we are just one twig on the tree of life challenges anthropocentrism (the idea that humans are the center of the universe).

## Criticism / Limitations
-   **Scarcity of Evidence:** The entire fossil record of early humans could fit in the back of a pickup truck. A single new bone can overturn established theories.
-   **Bias:** Historically, the field was dominated by white men who projected their own views of gender (Man the Hunter) and race onto the past.
