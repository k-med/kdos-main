## Overview
Cultural anthropology focuses on the study of cultural variation among humans. It is distinguished by its methodology, primarily participant observation (fieldwork), and its holistic approach to understanding human experience.

## Core Idea
The central concept is **culture**—the learned, shared, and transmitted values, beliefs, norms, and practices of a group. Cultural anthropologists seek to understand the internal logic of different societies.

## Formal Definition (if applicable)
**Culture** (E.B. Tylor): "That complex whole which includes knowledge, belief, art, morals, law, custom, and any other capabilities and habits acquired by man as a member of society."

## Intuition
Why do some cultures eat insects while others find it repulsive? Why do some societies trace descent through mothers and others through fathers? Cultural anthropology answers these questions by exploring the diversity of human solutions to life's problems.

## Examples
- **Trobriand Islanders:** Malinowski's study of the Kula ring exchange system.
- **Coming of Age in Samoa:** Margaret Mead's exploration of adolescence in Samoan society.
- **Urban Anthropology:** Studying subcultures within modern cities.

## Common Misconceptions
- "It's just studying 'primitive' tribes." (Anthropologists study all societies, including modern industrial ones.)
- "It's about collecting exotic artifacts." (It's about understanding social systems and meanings, not just objects.)

## Related Concepts
- **Ethnography:** The descriptive study of a particular human society.
- **Cultural Relativism:** The principle that an individual's beliefs and activities should be understood in terms of their own culture.
- **Ethnocentrism:** Judging another culture solely by the values and standards of one's own culture.

## Applications
- **International Development:** Understanding local contexts to implement effective programs.
- **User Research (UX):** Applying ethnographic methods to understand user behavior.
- **Global Business:** Navigating cultural differences in international markets.

## Criticism / Limitations
Early anthropology was often entangled with colonialism. Modern anthropology grapples with issues of representation, power dynamics, and the ethics of studying "others."
