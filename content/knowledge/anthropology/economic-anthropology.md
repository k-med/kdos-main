## Overview
While classical economics assumes humans are rational profit-maximizers ("Homo economicus"), anthropologists show that economic behavior is embedded in social relationships, religion, and politics.

## Core Idea
Polanyi identified three modes of exchange:
1.  **Reciprocity:** Exchange between equals (e.g., gift-giving).
2.  **Redistribution:** Goods flow to a center and are then redistributed (e.g., taxes, potlatch).
3.  **Market Exchange:** Buying and selling based on supply and demand.

## Formal Definition (if applicable)
**The Gift** (Mauss): Gifts are never truly free; they create a triple obligation: the obligation to give, to receive, and to reciprocate. This cycle creates social solidarity.

## Intuition
If you invite a friend to dinner, you don't charge them for the food. You expect them to invite you back later. That's reciprocity. If you paid them, it would turn a social relationship into a market transaction.

## Examples
- **Kula Ring:** A ceremonial exchange of shell necklaces and armbands in the Trobriand Islands that builds prestige and alliances.
- **Potlatch:** A Native American ceremony where wealth is given away or destroyed to demonstrate status.
- **Hunter-Gatherers:** Often described as the "original affluent society" because they satisfied their needs with little work.

## Common Misconceptions
- "Barter came before money." (Anthropological evidence suggests credit and gift systems preceded barter.)
- "Everyone wants to get rich." (In some societies, hoarding wealth is shameful; sharing is the goal.)

## Related Concepts
- **Moral Economy:** Economic activities guided by moral and social norms.
- **Cultural Materialism:** The theory that material conditions (resources, technology) determine culture.
- **Commodity Fetishism:** Perceiving value as inherent in objects rather than social labor.

## Applications
- **Development:** Designing economic programs that fit local cultural norms.
- **Marketing:** Understanding the cultural meaning of consumption.
- **Sustainability:** Learning from non-capitalist resource management systems.

## Criticism / Limitations
The debate between **Formalists** (who apply standard economic theory to all societies) and **Substantivists** (who argue economics is culturally specific) remains a central tension in the field.
