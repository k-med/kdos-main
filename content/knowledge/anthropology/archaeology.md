## Overview
Archaeology reconstructs past human behavior by examining the physical remains people left behind—artifacts, architecture, biofacts, and cultural landscapes. It is the primary source of knowledge for 99% of human history before writing.

## Core Idea
The archaeological record is a static reflection of dynamic past behaviors. Archaeologists use rigorous methods to excavate, date, and interpret these remains to understand how people lived, adapted, and changed over time.

## Formal Definition (if applicable)
**Stratigraphy:** The study of rock layers (strata) and the layering process (stratification). The **Law of Superposition** states that in undeformed stratigraphic sequences, the oldest strata will be at the bottom of the sequence.

## Intuition
Imagine finding a buried trash pit from 100 years ago. By analyzing the broken plates, bottles, and bones, you could reconstruct what the family ate, what they could afford, and how they lived. That is archaeology.

## Examples
- **Pompeii:** A Roman city frozen in time by volcanic ash, offering a snapshot of daily life.
- **Göbekli Tepe:** The world's oldest known temple, challenging theories about the origins of civilization.
- **Garbage Project:** Studying modern refuse to understand contemporary consumption patterns.

## Common Misconceptions
- "Archaeologists dig up dinosaurs." (That's paleontology. Archaeologists study humans.)
- "It's like Indiana Jones." (Real archaeology is slow, methodical, and scientific—not looting temples.)

## Related Concepts
- **Carbon Dating:** A method for determining the age of an object containing organic material.
- **Context:** The exact location of an artifact in relation to other artifacts and features.
- **Cultural Heritage Management:** The preservation and management of archaeological sites.

## Applications
- **History:** Filling gaps in the historical record.
- **Forensics:** Applying archaeological methods to crime scenes.
- **Climate Change:** Studying past human responses to environmental shifts.

## Criticism / Limitations
The archaeological record is incomplete and biased (stone survives better than wood). Interpretation is often subjective and can be influenced by contemporary political or social agendas.
