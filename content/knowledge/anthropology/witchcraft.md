  In anthropology, Witchcraft is not about pointy hats or Harry Potter. It is a social system for explaining misfortune. It is the belief that certain individuals have the innate, psychic power to cause harm to others, often unconsciously.

## Overview
Why do bad things happen to good people? Why did the granary collapse on *my* brother and not yours? Science says "termites" or "chance." Witchcraft says "malice." E.E. Evans-Pritchard's study of the Azande people (1937) showed that witchcraft is a rational way to explain the *coincidence* of misfortune. It answers the "Why me?" question.

## Core Idea
The core idea is **Social Tension**. Witchcraft accusations rarely happen between strangers. They happen between neighbors, co-wives, or rivals. When you get sick, you ask: "Who hates me?" The accusation brings hidden social conflicts into the open so they can be resolved.

## Formal Definition
The use of psychic power (often innate and inherited) to cause harm. Distinguished from **Sorcery**, which involves the use of spells, medicines, and rituals. (A witch *is* evil; a sorcerer *does* evil things).

## Intuition
Imagine you trip and break your leg.
-   **Physics:** "Gravity + weak bone = break."
-   **Witchcraft:** "I know gravity made me fall. But *why* did I fall *today*? Why *here*? It must be because my neighbor is jealous of my new car and 'witched' me."
It provides a *social* cause for a physical event.

## Examples
-   **The Azande:** They believe witchcraft is a physical substance (*mangu*) in the belly. A witch might not even know they are a witch. If they get angry, the *mangu* flies out and hurts someone. The solution is to perform an oracle (poison a chicken) to find the witch, then ask them to cool down.
-   **Salem Witch Trials:** A case where social tension (land disputes, religious anxiety) in a small community exploded into mass hysteria and accusations.
-   **Modern Africa:** In some cities, "witchcraft" is used to explain the inequality of capitalism. If someone gets rich overnight, people suspect they used "zombie" workers or occult means.

## Common Misconceptions
-   **It's fake:** To the believer, it is as real as a virus. It causes real fear and real death.
-   **It's devil worship:** This is a Christian projection. In most traditional societies, witchcraft has nothing to do with Satan; it is just a part of human nature (jealousy weaponized).

## Related Concepts
-   **The Evil Eye:** A widespread belief (Mediterranean, Middle East) that a gaze of envy can cause harm. It is a mild form of witchcraft.
-   **Scapegoating:** Blaming a vulnerable person (often an older woman) for the problems of the community.
-   **Functionalism:** Witchcraft functions as a "leveling mechanism." It stops people from hoarding wealth, because if you get too rich, people will think you are a witch.

## Applications
-   **Law:** In some countries, courts have to deal with people who kill "witches" in self-defense. How does a secular law deal with a magical crime?
-   **Health:** Understanding that a patient might believe their AIDS is caused by witchcraft, not just a virus, changes how you treat them.

## Criticism / Limitations
-   **Rationality Debate:** Can we say witchcraft is "rational"? Yes, it is internally consistent. But it is empirically false. This tension (between respecting the culture and acknowledging reality) is a key debate in anthropology.
-   **Gender:** Witchcraft accusations are overwhelmingly directed at women, serving as a tool of patriarchal control.
