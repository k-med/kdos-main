## Overview
Kinship is one of the foundational topics in anthropology. It explains how societies organize themselves, define who is related to whom, and determine rights, obligations, and inheritance.

## Core Idea
Kinship is not just biology; it is a cultural construction. Different societies have vastly different ways of classifying relatives (e.g., calling your father's brother "father" or your mother's sister "mother").

## Formal Definition (if applicable)
**Descent Groups:**
- **Patrilineal:** Descent traced through the father's line.
- **Matrilineal:** Descent traced through the mother's line.
- **Bilateral:** Descent traced through both parents (common in Western societies).

## Intuition
In the US, your "cousin" is the same relation whether on your mom's or dad's side. In some cultures, your "cross-cousin" (mother's brother's child) is a preferred marriage partner, while your "parallel cousin" (mother's sister's child) is considered a sibling and taboo to marry.

## Examples
- **Iroquois Kinship:** A system where a father and father's brother are referred to by the same term, as are a mother and mother's sister.
- **Clans:** Large descent groups who claim a common (often mythical) ancestor.
- **Fictive Kinship:** Treating non-relatives as family (e.g., godparents, "blood brothers").

## Common Misconceptions
- "Kinship is natural/biological." (It is a social system; adoption and marriage create kin just as biology does.)
- "Matrilineal means matriarchal." (Tracing descent through women doesn't necessarily mean women hold political power.)

## Related Concepts
- **Exogamy/Endogamy:** Rules about marrying outside or inside a specific group.
- **Lineage:** A group demonstrating common descent from a known ancestor.
- **Nuclear vs. Extended Family:** Different household structures.

## Applications
- **Genetic Counseling:** Understanding family histories and cultural views on inheritance.
- **Law:** Defining legal heirs and custody rights.
- **Social Work:** Navigating family dynamics in diverse communities.

## Criticism / Limitations
Classic kinship studies were sometimes overly rigid and algebraic, ignoring the fluidity of actual social relations. "New Kinship Studies" focus more on how relatedness is *practiced* (e.g., through care and feeding) rather than just formal structures.
