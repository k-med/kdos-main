  Forensic Anthropology is the application of the science of physical anthropology (skeletal biology) to the legal process. It involves the identification of skeletal, badly decomposed, or otherwise unidentified human remains.

## Overview
When a body is found that is too decomposed for a standard autopsy, the forensic anthropologist is called in. They are the experts of the skeleton. They can look at a pile of bones and tell you: Was this a man or a woman? How old were they? How tall? What ancestry? And, crucially, how did they die? It is the intersection of biology and justice.

## Core Idea
The core idea is **biological profile**. The skeleton is not a static frame; it is a living record of your life. Your sex is written in your pelvis; your age in your ribs and teeth; your ancestry in your skull; your lifestyle in your muscle attachments. The anthropologist translates this biological code into a profile to help police identify the victim.

## Formal Definition
The application of biological anthropology and osteology (study of bones) in a legal setting, usually for the recovery and identification of human remains and the determination of the time since death (post-mortem interval) and trauma analysis.

## Intuition
Think of the TV show *Bones*. While exaggerated, the premise is real. A skull is found in the woods. The anthropologist looks at the brow ridge (large = male?), the sutures (fused = old?), and the teeth (fillings = modern?). They find a nick on a rib—a knife mark. They don't solve the crime (that's the detective's job), but they give the victim a name and a voice.

## Examples
-   **Mass Disasters:** After 9/11 or the 2004 Tsunami, forensic anthropologists worked for years to identify thousands of fragmented remains to return them to families.
-   **War Crimes:** In places like Bosnia, Rwanda, or Argentina, anthropologists excavate mass graves to document genocide and provide evidence for international courts.
-   **Historical Mysteries:** Identifying the remains of the Romanov family or King Richard III (found under a parking lot).

## Common Misconceptions
-   **They determine "Cause of Death":** Technically, only a Medical Examiner (MD) can sign the death certificate. The anthropologist determines "trauma" (e.g., "blunt force to the skull"), which supports the ME's finding.
-   **It's instant:** DNA is faster, but you need a sample to compare it to. If you have a skeleton and no idea who it is, you need the biological profile to narrow down the missing persons list first.

## Related Concepts
-   **Osteology:** The scientific study of bones. All forensic anthropologists are osteologists.
-   **Taphonomy:** The study of what happens to a body after death (decomposition, scavenging by animals, weathering). This helps determine *when* the person died.
-   **Paleopathology:** The study of ancient diseases in bones.

## Applications
-   **Human Rights:** The "Forensic Turn" in human rights work uses the scientific objectivity of bones to counter state denial of atrocities.
-   **Archaeology:** The same skills are used to study ancient populations (e.g., determining the health of a Roman gladiator).

## Criticism / Limitations
-   **Race Determination:** Estimating "ancestry" from a skull is controversial. While biological patterns exist, "race" is a social construct. Anthropologists must be careful not to reinforce scientific racism.
-   **The "CSI Effect":** Juries now expect high-tech, definitive forensic evidence in every case, which real science cannot always provide.
