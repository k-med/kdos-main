## Overview
This field bridges the gap between biological and social sciences. It explores human origins, evolution, and variation, asking what makes us biologically human and how culture interacts with biology.

## Core Idea
Humans are products of both biological evolution (natural selection) and cultural evolution. Biological anthropologists study this biocultural interface through fossils, genetics, and primate behavior.

## Formal Definition (if applicable)
**Hominin:** The group consisting of modern humans, extinct human species and all our immediate ancestors (including members of the genera *Homo*, *Australopithecus*, *Paranthropus* and *Ardipithecus*).

## Intuition
Why do humans walk on two legs? Why do we have large brains? Why does skin color vary? Biological anthropology uses scientific evidence to answer these fundamental questions about our species.

## Examples
- **Lucy (Australopithecus afarensis):** A famous fossil skeleton providing evidence for early bipedalism.
- **Jane Goodall's Chimpanzees:** Studying our closest living relatives to understand early human behavior.
- **Forensic Anthropology:** Identifying human remains in legal contexts (e.g., *Bones*).

## Common Misconceptions
- "Humans evolved from monkeys." (We share a common ancestor with monkeys; we did not evolve *from* them.)
- "Race is a biological reality." (Biological anthropology has shown that race is a social construct with no basis in genetic subspecies.)

## Related Concepts
- **Paleoanthropology:** The study of human fossils.
- **Primatology:** The study of non-human primates.
- **Human Osteology:** The study of the human skeleton.

## Applications
- **Medicine:** Understanding evolutionary reasons for diseases.
- **Forensics:** Assisting in criminal investigations and disaster victim identification.
- **Ergonomics:** Using body measurements to design better tools and spaces.

## Criticism / Limitations
Interpreting sparse fossil evidence can lead to conflicting theories. The field also faces ethical challenges regarding the treatment of human remains, particularly of indigenous peoples.
