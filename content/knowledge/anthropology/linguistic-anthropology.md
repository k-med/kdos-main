## Overview
Language is not just a tool for describing the world; it is a social action. Linguistic anthropologists examine language in its cultural context, looking at how speaking creates social reality.

## Core Idea
The **Sapir-Whorf Hypothesis** (Linguistic Relativity) suggests that the structure of a language affects its speakers' world view or cognition. While the strong version (determinism) is largely rejected, the weak version (influence) is widely accepted.

## Formal Definition (if applicable)
**Indexicality:** The phenomenon where a sign points to (indexes) some element of the context in which it occurs (e.g., an accent pointing to a speaker's regional origin or class).

## Intuition
Using formal language in a job interview versus slang with friends isn't just about grammar; it's about navigating social hierarchies and identities. Linguistic anthropology unpacks these unwritten rules.

## Examples
- **Code-Switching:** Alternating between two or more languages or varieties in a single conversation.
- **Honorifics:** How languages like Japanese or Korean encode social status in grammar.
- **Language Revitalization:** Efforts to save endangered languages and the cultural knowledge they contain.

## Common Misconceptions
- "It's just learning languages." (It's analyzing *how* language is used socially.)
- "Some languages are primitive." (All human languages are equally complex and capable of expressing any thought.)

## Related Concepts
- **Sociolinguistics:** The study of language in relation to social factors.
- **Pragmatics:** The study of how context contributes to meaning.
- **Semiotics:** The study of signs and symbols.

## Applications
- **Education:** Improving language instruction for diverse populations.
- **Intercultural Communication:** Facilitating better understanding between groups.
- **Policy:** Advocating for linguistic rights and preservation.

## Criticism / Limitations
Documenting dying languages raises ethical questions about ownership and the role of the researcher. The field also struggles with the tension between documenting "pure" traditional forms and studying dynamic modern usage.
