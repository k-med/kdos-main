## Overview
Museums are not neutral containers of facts. They are powerful institutions that tell us what is valuable and what is not. Museum Studies asks: Who gets to decide what goes in the glass case? Why are Greek statues in London? Why do we whisper in art galleries? It examines the museum as a "contact zone" between cultures.

## Core Idea
The core idea is **representation and power**. Historically, museums were tools of colonialism. They displayed the "spoils of war" and categorized non-Western people as "primitive" specimens alongside flora and fauna. Modern museum studies focuses on **decolonizing** the museum—giving voice and authority back to the communities whose heritage is on display.

## Formal Definition
The theoretical and practical study of museum history, organization, and management, with a focus on the ethical and social implications of cultural heritage management.

## Intuition
Walk into a Natural History Museum. You see dinosaurs, rocks, and... Native Americans. Why are Native Americans in the *Natural* History museum (with the animals), while Greeks and Romans are in the *Art* Museum? This classification implies that Indigenous people are part of "nature" (primitive), while Europeans are part of "culture" (civilized). Museum studies critiques these hidden messages.

## Examples
-   **Repatriation:** The movement to return stolen artifacts (like the Benin Bronzes or the Elgin Marbles) to their countries of origin.
-   **The "Blockbuster" Exhibition:** The trend of huge, ticketed shows (e.g., "Treasures of Tutankhamun") that turn culture into a spectacle and a revenue stream.
-   **Ecomuseums:** Museums without walls, where a whole community preserves its living heritage in situ, rather than locking objects away in a building.

## Common Misconceptions
-   **Museums preserve the past:** They *construct* the past. Curators choose a specific narrative. A display of "The American West" might focus on cowboys and ignore the genocide of Indigenous peoples.
-   **It's just for curators:** It is a vital field for anyone interested in public history, education, and cultural politics.

## Related Concepts
-   **NAGPRA:** The Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (1990), a US law requiring museums to return human remains and sacred objects to tribes.
-   **Intangible Heritage:** UNESCO's concept that culture isn't just objects (vases), but practices (dance, cuisine, language) that museums struggle to display.
-   **The White Cube:** The standard aesthetic of modern art galleries (white walls, silence) designed to isolate the art from the world.

## Applications
-   **Education:** Museums are major sites of informal learning.
-   **Tourism:** Museums are engines of economic development (the "Bilbao Effect").
-   **Reconciliation:** Museums can be spaces for healing historical wounds (e.g., Holocaust museums, Apartheid museums).

## Criticism / Limitations
-   **Elitism:** Museums are often seen as intimidating spaces for the educated elite, unwelcoming to the working class.
-   **Funding:** The tension between the educational mission and the need to find corporate sponsors (who might want to sanitize the exhibits).
