## Overview
When you hear "cyborg," you think of RoboCop. But Cyborg Anthropology says: look at your hand. Is there a smartphone in it? Do you panic if you lose it? Does it remember phone numbers so your brain doesn't have to? Then you are a cyborg. A cyborg is a cybernetic organism—a hybrid of machine and biology. This field studies how tools don't just help us, but *change* us.

## Core Idea
The core idea is **extension**. Technology extends the human body and mind. A car extends your legs. A phone extends your memory. The internet extends your nervous system. Therefore, you cannot study "humans" in isolation; you must study the human-machine system.

## Formal Definition
A subfield of anthropology that looks at how humans and non-human objects (machines, software, algorithms) co-evolve. It challenges the boundary between "subject" (human) and "object" (tool).

## Intuition
If a blind person uses a cane, the cane becomes part of their sensory system. They feel the sidewalk *through* the cane. The cane is not a tool; it is an organ. Cyborg anthropology argues that we are all like that blind person, but our canes are iPhones, pacemakers, and Google Maps.

## Examples
-   **Donna Haraway's "Cyborg Manifesto":** The founding text. She argued that the cyborg is a feminist icon because it rejects the rigid boundaries of gender and nature. It is a creature of fusion and fluidity.
-   **Quantified Self:** People who track their steps, sleep, and heart rate with Fitbits. They are using data to understand and modify their own biology.
-   **Drone Warfare:** The pilot sits in Nevada; the drone flies in Afghanistan. The pilot's eyes are 7,000 miles away from their body. This is a cyborg experience of war.

## Common Misconceptions
-   **It's science fiction:** It is about the here and now. Glasses, vaccines, and writing are all technologies that make us cyborgs.
-   **It's about robots:** It's mostly about *interfaces*—screens, keyboards, voice commands—and how they shape our social interactions.

## Related Concepts
-   **Posthumanism:** The philosophical view that we are moving beyond the traditional definition of "human" (autonomous, biological) towards a state where we are networked and enhanced.
-   **Actor-Network Theory (ANT):** Bruno Latour's theory that objects (like a door-closer or a speed bump) have "agency" and act on people just as people act on them.
-   **The Singularity:** The hypothetical future point where machine intelligence surpasses human intelligence.

## Applications
-   **UX Design:** Designing interfaces that feel "natural" (like an extension of the body) rather than clunky tools.
-   **Disability Studies:** Reframing prosthetics not as "fixing" a broken body, but as a valid form of cyborg existence.

## Criticism / Limitations
-   **Techno-Optimism:** It can sometimes sound like a breathless advertisement for Silicon Valley ("We are all becoming gods!"), ignoring the digital divide (not everyone has an iPhone).
-   **Loss of Humanity:** Critics argue that merging with machines erodes our empathy and attention span.
