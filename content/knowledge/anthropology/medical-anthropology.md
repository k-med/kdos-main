## Overview
Health is not just a biological fact; it is a cultural construct. Medical anthropologists study "ethnomedicine" (traditional healing systems) as well as "biomedicine" (Western medicine) as cultural systems.

## Core Idea
The distinction between **Disease** (biological pathology) and **Illness** (the patient's subjective experience of suffering). Doctors treat disease; patients suffer illness.

## Formal Definition (if applicable)
**Structural Violence:** Social arrangements that put individuals and populations in harm's way (e.g., poverty, racism), leading to health disparities.

## Intuition
In the West, a virus causes the flu. In another culture, it might be caused by a curse or soul loss. The treatment (antibiotics vs. ritual) follows the cultural logic of the cause.

## Examples
- **Placebo Effect:** The power of belief in the healing process.
- **Culture-Bound Syndromes:** Illnesses specific to a culture (e.g., *Susto* in Latin America, *Amok* in Malaysia).
- **Biomedicine as Culture:** Analyzing the rituals of hospitals (white coats, jargon) and the authority of doctors.

## Common Misconceptions
- "Traditional medicine is superstition." (Many traditional remedies are pharmacologically active, and the holistic approach can be effective.)
- "Western medicine is purely objective." (It is also influenced by cultural assumptions about the body and individualism.)

## Related Concepts
- **Medical Pluralism:** The coexistence of multiple healing systems in one society.
- **Somatization:** The expression of psychological distress through physical symptoms.
- **Critical Medical Anthropology:** Focusing on the political economy of health.

## Applications
- **Public Health:** Designing culturally appropriate interventions (e.g., for Ebola or HIV).
- **Clinical Practice:** Improving doctor-patient communication through cultural competence.
- **Global Health:** Addressing health inequalities.

## Criticism / Limitations
Balancing respect for cultural beliefs with the need to address harmful practices (e.g., FGM, denial of vaccines) is a constant ethical challenge.
