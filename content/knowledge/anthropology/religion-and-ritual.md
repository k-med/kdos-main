## Overview
Religion is a cultural universal. Anthropologists examine how religious beliefs and practices organize social life, provide comfort, explain the unknown, and legitimize power.

## Core Idea
Durkheim argued that religion is society worshipping itself—rituals create "collective effervescence" that binds the group together. Geertz viewed religion as a "cultural system" of symbols that establish powerful moods and motivations.

## Formal Definition (if applicable)
**Ritual:** A repetitive, stylized act performed in specific places and times, often involving the manipulation of sacred symbols. **Rites of Passage** (Van Gennep) mark transitions between social statuses (e.g., childhood to adulthood) and have three stages: separation, liminality, and incorporation.

## Intuition
Why do we shake hands, stand for anthems, or blow out birthday candles? These are secular rituals. Religious rituals work similarly but connect participants to a sacred or supernatural order.

## Examples
- **Shamanism:** A practice where a practitioner alters their consciousness to interact with the spirit world for healing or divination.
- **Totemism:** A belief system where a group has a spiritual connection to a specific animal or plant.
- **Witchcraft:** Used in some societies (like the Azande) to explain misfortune and manage social tensions.

## Common Misconceptions
- "Rituals are empty habits." (They are deeply meaningful and functional for participants.)
- "Magic is just fake science." (Malinowski showed that magic is used to manage anxiety in uncontrollable situations, like deep-sea fishing.)

## Related Concepts
- **Liminality:** The "betwixt and between" state during a rite of passage.
- **Syncretism:** The blending of different religious beliefs.
- **Animism:** The belief that non-human entities (plants, animals, objects) possess a spiritual essence.

## Applications
- **Conflict Resolution:** Understanding the religious dimensions of political conflicts.
- **Healthcare:** Navigating religious objections to medical treatments.
- **Organizational Culture:** Analyzing corporate rituals and myths.

## Criticism / Limitations
Functionalist explanations can sometimes ignore how religion can also be a source of conflict, oppression, or social change, not just stability.
