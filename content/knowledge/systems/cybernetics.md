## Overview
**Cybernetics** (from Greek *kybernetes* "steersman") is the science of control and communication in animals and machines. It explains how systems steer themselves toward a goal.

## Core Idea
The core idea is **circular causality**. Information flows from the system to the controller and back. This is the **Feedback Loop**.

## Formal Definition
The scientific study of control and communication in the animal and the machine. (Norbert Wiener).

## Intuition
-   **The Thermostat:** The classic example.
    1.  Goal: 70 degrees.
    2.  Sensor: It's 68.
    3.  Effector: Turn on furnace.
    4.  Feedback: It's now 70. Turn off.
-   **Homeostasis:** Your body is a cybernetic system. It sweats to cool down and shivers to warm up.

## Examples
-   **Guided Missiles:** They don't fly straight; they constantly correct their path based on the target's position (Negative Feedback).
-   **Management:** A manager sets a goal, checks performance, and adjusts strategy.

## Common Misconceptions
-   **Misconception:** It's about cyborgs.
    -   **Correction:** Sci-fi hijacked the word. It's really about *information flow*.
-   **Misconception:** It's just engineering.
    -   **Correction:** It applies to biology, sociology (Second-Order Cybernetics), and family therapy.

## Related Concepts
-   **[Systems Thinking](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/systems/systems-thinking.md):** Cybernetics is a subset of systems theory.
-   **[Information Theory](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/systems/information-theory.md):** The math of communication.
-   **[Artificial Intelligence](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/computer-science/artificial-intelligence.md):** Early AI was heavily influenced by cybernetics.

## Applications
-   **Robotics:** Control systems.
-   **Biology:** Understanding the nervous system.

## Criticism and Limitations
-   **Black Box:** It focuses on input/output, often ignoring the internal mechanism.
