## Overview
**Feedback Loops** are the engines of change and stability. They are the reason things grow (compound interest) and the reason things stay the same (body temperature).

## Core Idea
The core idea is **circularity**. A causes B, and B causes A.
-   **Reinforcing (Positive) Feedback:** A produces more B, which produces more A. (Explosion, Growth).
-   **Balancing (Negative) Feedback:** A produces B, which reduces A. (Stability, Goal-seeking).

## Formal Definition
A situation where some of the output of a system returns to the input.

## Intuition
-   **Microphone Squeal (Positive Feedback):** Sound goes in mic -> Amp -> Speaker -> Mic -> Louder Sound. Loop continues until *SCREECH*.
-   **Toilet Flush (Negative Feedback):** Water level drops -> Float drops -> Valve opens -> Water fills -> Float rises -> Valve closes.

## Examples
-   **Compound Interest (Positive):** Money earns interest. Interest becomes principal. Earns more interest.
-   **Predator-Prey (Balancing):** More rabbits -> More wolves -> Fewer rabbits -> Fewer wolves -> More rabbits.
-   **Viral Content (Positive):** More likes -> Shown to more people -> More likes.

## Common Misconceptions
-   **Misconception:** Positive feedback is "good" and negative feedback is "bad."
    -   **Correction:** "Positive" means *adding* (amplifying). "Negative" means *subtracting* (stabilizing). Positive feedback can be bad (cancer, panic). Negative feedback can be good (thermostat).
-   **Misconception:** Loops happen instantly.
    -   **Correction:** There are often **Delays**. A delay in a balancing loop causes oscillation (like a shower that's too hot, then too cold).

## Related Concepts
-   **[Systems Thinking](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/systems/systems-thinking.md):** Feedback is the vocabulary of systems.
-   **[Cybernetics](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/systems/cybernetics.md):** The study of negative feedback.

## Applications
-   **Climate Change:** Melting ice reflects less sun -> Warmer -> More melting (Positive Feedback).
-   **Business:** Viral loops for growth.
-   **Engineering:** Control systems.

## Criticism and Limitations
-   **Runaway Loops:** Positive feedback eventually hits a limit (collapse), or the system destroys itself.
