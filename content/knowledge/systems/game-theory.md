## Overview
**Game Theory** is the science of strategy. It's not just about games like chess or poker; it's about any situation where your success depends on what *others* do. It applies to war, business, biology, and dating.

## Core Idea
The core idea is **interdependence**. In a "game," the outcome for each player depends on the actions of all players. You must anticipate what others will do, knowing they are anticipating what *you* will do.

## Formal Definition
The study of mathematical models of conflict and cooperation between intelligent rational decision-makers.

## Intuition
-   **The Prisoner's Dilemma:** Two criminals are arrested.
    -   If both stay silent, they get 1 year.
    -   If one betrays and the other stays silent, the betrayer goes free, and the silent one gets 10 years.
    -   If both betray, they get 5 years.
    -   *Result:* Rational self-interest leads both to betray, resulting in a worse outcome for both (5 years) than if they had cooperated (1 year).

## Examples
-   **Nuclear War (Mutually Assured Destruction):** A game of "Chicken." If one side backs down, they lose face. If neither backs down, everyone dies.
-   **Evolution:** Animals play games. Hawks (aggressive) vs. Doves (peaceful). The stable ratio of hawks to doves is a Game Theory equilibrium.
-   **Auctions:** How much should you bid? It depends on what you think others will bid.

## Common Misconceptions
-   **Misconception:** It's about winning.
    -   **Correction:** It's often about finding an **Equilibrium** (Nash Equilibrium)—a state where no player can improve their situation by changing their strategy alone.
-   **Misconception:** People are always rational.
    -   **Correction:** Traditional Game Theory assumes rationality. **Behavioral Game Theory** accounts for human irrationality (emotions, fairness).

## Related Concepts
-   **[Nash Equilibrium](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/mathematics/nash-equilibrium.md):** The central concept.
-   **[Zero-Sum Game](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/mathematics/zero-sum-game.md):** My gain is your loss (Poker).
-   **[Non-Zero-Sum Game](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/mathematics/non-zero-sum-game.md):** Win-win or lose-lose (Trade, Marriage).

## Applications
-   **Economics:** Pricing strategies, oligopolies.
-   **Political Science:** Voting systems, international treaties.
-   **Biology:** Evolutionary Stable Strategies.

## Criticism and Limitations
-   **Rationality Assumption:** Real humans often act out of spite or altruism, violating the "rational" predictions.
