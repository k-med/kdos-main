## Overview
**Systems Thinking** is seeing the forest, not just the trees. It's moving from linear thinking (A causes B) to circular thinking (A causes B, which causes A).

## Core Idea
The core idea is **interconnectedness**. You can't change just one thing. Everything is connected to everything else.

## Formal Definition
A discipline for seeing wholes. It is a framework for seeing interrelationships rather than things, for seeing patterns of change rather than static snapshots.

## Intuition
-   **The Iceberg Model:**
    -   *Events:* What happened? (The fire).
    -   *Patterns:* Has this happened before? (Fires happen every summer).
    -   *Structure:* What causes the patterns? (Climate change, forest management).
    -   *Mental Models:* What beliefs drive the structure? ("Nature exists for us to exploit").
-   **The Slinky:** If you push a slinky, its behavior is determined by its internal structure (coils), not just your push.

## Examples
-   **Cobra Effect:** The British offered a bounty for dead cobras in India. People started breeding cobras to get the money. When the bounty ended, they released them. Result: More cobras. (Unintended consequences of linear thinking).
-   **Climate Change:** A complex system where CO2, oceans, forests, and economy all interact.

## Common Misconceptions
-   **Misconception:** It's just "big picture" thinking.
    -   **Correction:** It's rigorous analysis of feedback loops, stocks, and flows.
-   **Misconception:** You can control a system.
    -   **Correction:** You can only *dance* with a system. You can't control it perfectly.

## Related Concepts
-   **[Feedback Loops](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/systems/feedback-loops.md):** The engine of systems.
-   **[Emergence](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/systems/emergence.md):** The whole is greater than the sum of its parts.
-   **[Cybernetics](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/systems/cybernetics.md):** The study of control in systems.

## Applications
-   **Business:** Supply chain management.
-   **Ecology:** Ecosystem management.
-   **Public Policy:** Avoiding policy resistance.

## Criticism and Limitations
-   **Paralysis:** Seeing *everything* as connected can make it hard to act. "Analysis Paralysis."
