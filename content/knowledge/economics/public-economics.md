## Overview
When should the government intervene? Public economics answers this. It studies taxes (who pays?), spending (who benefits?), and market failures (when the free market messes up).

## Core Idea
**Market Failure:** When the invisible hand drops the ball. Common causes:
1.  **Externalities:** Pollution (negative), Education (positive).
2.  **Public Goods:** National defense, clean air.
3.  **Information Asymmetry:** Used car markets, insurance.

## Formal Definition (if applicable)
**Public Good:** A good that is non-excludable (you can't stop people from using it) and non-rivalrous (my use doesn't hurt your use). Example: A lighthouse.

## Intuition
- **Taxation:** Plucking the goose with the least amount of hissing.
- **Tragedy of the Commons:** If a pasture is open to all, everyone will overgraze it until it's destroyed. Solution: Property rights or regulation.

## Examples
- **Carbon Tax:** Making polluters pay for the damage they cause.
- **Social Security:** A government pension system.
- **Public Education:** Subsidized because it benefits society as a whole.

## Common Misconceptions
- "Taxes are theft." (Taxes are the price we pay for a civilized society—roads, police, courts.)
- "Free markets always work." (They fail often, requiring government correction.)

## Related Concepts
- **Deadweight Loss:** The economic inefficiency caused by taxes.
- **Progressive Tax:** Rich pay a higher percentage.
- **Regressive Tax:** Poor pay a higher percentage (e.g., sales tax).

## Applications
- **Budgeting:** Balancing the deficit.
- **Healthcare Reform:** Designing insurance markets.
- **Environmental Protection:** Cap-and-trade systems.

## Criticism / Limitations
Government failure is also real. Politicians may act in their own self-interest (Public Choice Theory) rather than for the public good.
