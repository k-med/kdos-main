  In economics, an externality is a cost or benefit that is imposed on a third party who did not agree to incur that cost or benefit. Air pollution from motor vehicles is an example of a negative externality. The costs of the air pollution are imposed on the whole of society, while the drivers of motor vehicles are not directly compensating the whole of society for the costs of the air pollution.

## Overview
The Free Market is great at setting prices, but it has a blind spot. It ignores "side effects." If a factory pollutes the air, the factory owner gets rich, but the neighbors get sick. The sickness is a cost that isn't included in the price of the product. That is an Externality.

## Core Idea
The core idea is **Mispricing**. The price tag is wrong.
-   **Negative Externality:** The product is too cheap because the seller isn't paying for the damage (Pollution).
-   **Positive Externality:** The product is too expensive because the buyer isn't paid for the benefit (Vaccines).

## Formal Definition
A cost or benefit caused by a producer that is not financially incurred or received by that producer.
**Pigovian Tax:** A tax designed to fix this. Tax the pollution until the price reflects the true cost.

## Intuition
-   **The Party:** Your neighbor throws a loud party. He enjoys it (Benefit). You can't sleep (Cost). He is imposing a "Negative Externality" on you.
-   **The Garden:** Your neighbor plants beautiful flowers. He enjoys them. You also enjoy looking at them (Benefit). He is providing a "Positive Externality."

## Examples
-   **Carbon Tax:** Burning gas causes climate change (Externality). A Carbon Tax makes gas more expensive, forcing drivers to pay for the environmental damage.
-   **Education:** An educated person is less likely to commit crime and more likely to invent things. This benefits everyone, not just the student. That's why the government subsidizes schools (Positive Externality).
-   **Smoking:** Second-hand smoke harms others. High taxes on cigarettes are meant to offset this cost to the healthcare system.

## Common Misconceptions
-   **Pollution should be zero:** Economically, the optimal amount of pollution is not zero. It's the point where the cost of cleaning it up equals the damage it causes. (Zero pollution means zero factories).

## Related Concepts
-   **Tragedy of the Commons:** When everyone acts in their own self-interest and destroys a shared resource (Overfishing).
-   **Coase Theorem:** If property rights are clear and transaction costs are low, people can bargain to solve externalities without government. (You pay your neighbor $50 to turn down the music).

## Applications
-   **Cap and Trade:** A system where the government sets a limit on pollution and lets companies trade permits.

## Criticism / Limitations
-   **Valuation:** How much is a polar bear worth? It's hard to put a price tag on nature, so it's hard to set the right tax.
