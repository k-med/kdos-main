## Overview
Traditional economics assumes we are "Homo economicus"—perfectly rational calculators. Behavioral economics says we are Homer Simpson—impulsive, emotional, and prone to mistakes.

## Core Idea
**Bounded Rationality:** Our rationality is limited by our cognitive capacity, the information we have, and the time available. We don't optimize; we satisfice (aim for "good enough").

## Formal Definition (if applicable)
**Prospect Theory:** People value gains and losses differently. The pain of losing $100 is greater than the joy of finding $100 (Loss Aversion).

## Intuition
Why do you buy a gym membership but never go? Why do you save more if the plan is "opt-out" rather than "opt-in"? Because we are lazy, optimistic, and bad at predicting our future selves.

## Examples
- **Nudge:** Putting fruit at eye level in the cafeteria to encourage healthy eating.
- **Sunk Cost Fallacy:** Finishing a bad movie just because you paid for the ticket.
- **Anchoring:** Buying a $50 shirt because it was marked down from $100 (even if it's only worth $50).

## Common Misconceptions
- "It proves we are stupid." (No, it proves we are human. Our biases often serve as useful shortcuts or heuristics.)
- "It replaces standard economics." (It complements it by adding psychological realism.)

## Related Concepts
- **Heuristics:** Mental shortcuts used to make quick decisions.
- **Hyperbolic Discounting:** Preferring $10 today over $15 next week (impatience).
- **Choice Architecture:** Designing the environment to influence decisions.

## Applications
- **Policy:** Designing 401(k) plans to increase savings rates.
- **Marketing:** Pricing strategies (e.g., "Buy one, get one free").
- **Finance:** Understanding market bubbles and crashes.

## Criticism / Limitations
Some findings have failed to replicate (Replication Crisis in psychology). Also, "nudging" can be seen as manipulative or paternalistic.
