## Overview
We assume politicians want to "serve the public." Public Choice Theory says: "Nonsense. Politicians are humans. They want money, power, and to get re-elected." It applies the logic of economics (self-interest) to politics. It explains why the government is often inefficient and corrupt.

## Core Idea
The core idea is **Politics without Romance**. Treat politicians like businessmen selling a product (laws) to customers (voters/lobbyists).

## Formal Definition
The use of economic tools to deal with traditional problems of political science.
Founded by **James Buchanan** (Nobel Prize).

## Intuition
-   **Concentrated Benefits, Dispersed Costs:**
    -   Sugar Tariff: It benefits 5,000 sugar farmers a lot ($1 million each). It costs 300 million Americans a little ($1 each).
    -   Result: The farmers lobby hard. The public doesn't care. The tariff passes. This explains why special interests always win.

## Examples
-   **Rent Seeking:** Spending money to get a government favor (a subsidy or monopoly) instead of creating value. It's easier to lobby Congress for a tax break than to invent a better mousetrap.
-   **Rational Ignorance:** Why don't voters study the issues? Because one vote doesn't matter. The "cost" of learning is high, the "benefit" is zero. So voters stay ignorant.

## Common Misconceptions
-   **Bureaucrats are lazy:** No, they are rational. In the private sector, you get promoted for profit. In government, you get promoted for having a bigger budget. So bureaucrats always try to expand their department, even if it's useless.

## Related Concepts
-   **Logrolling:** "I'll vote for your bridge if you vote for my stadium."
-   **Regulatory Capture:** When the bank regulators start working for the banks they are supposed to regulate.

## Applications
-   **Constitutional Economics:** Designing rules (like Term Limits or Balanced Budget Amendments) to limit the damage politicians can do.

## Criticism / Limitations
-   **Cynicism:** It assumes no one is ever altruistic. Some politicians *do* care about the country.

## Further Reading
-   Buchanan, James and Tullock, Gordon. *The Calculus of Consent*.
