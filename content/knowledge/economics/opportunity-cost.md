## Overview
There is no such thing as a free lunch. Even if someone buys it for you, you paid for it with your *time*. Opportunity Cost is the value of the thing you *didn't* choose. It is the fundamental concept of economics because resources (time, money) are scarce.

## Core Idea
The core idea is **Trade-offs**. To get X, you must give up Y. The cost of X is Y.

## Formal Definition
The loss of potential gain from other alternatives when one alternative is chosen.
Formula: **Opportunity Cost = Return on Best Forgone Option - Return on Chosen Option.**

## Intuition
-   **College:** What is the cost of college?
    -   Tuition: $20,000.
    -   Books: $1,000.
    -   **Opportunity Cost:** The $40,000 salary you *didn't* earn because you were studying instead of working.
    -   **Total Cost:** $61,000.

## Examples
-   **War:** Eisenhower said: "Every gun that is made signifies, in the final sense, a theft from those who hunger and are not fed." The cost of a bomber is 30 schools.
-   **Investing:** If you keep $10,000 under your mattress, the cost is the $500 interest you *could* have earned in the stock market.

## Common Misconceptions
-   **Sunk Cost Fallacy:** "I already spent $100 on this ticket, so I have to go to the concert even though I'm sick." No. The money is gone. The choice now is: Go (and be miserable) or Stay Home (and rest). Opportunity cost says stay home.

## Related Concepts
-   **Scarcity:** The reason opportunity cost exists. If we had infinite time and money, we could do everything.
-   **TANSTAAFL:** "There Ain't No Such Thing As A Free Lunch."

## Applications
-   **Decision Making:** Whenever you make a choice, ask: "What am I giving up?" It clarifies your priorities.

## Criticism / Limitations
-   **Psychology:** Humans are bad at calculating this. We overvalue what we have (Loss Aversion) and undervalue what we *could* have.
