## Overview
Microeconomics zooms in. Instead of looking at the whole economy (GDP), it looks at how you decide to buy coffee vs. tea, or how a company decides how many cars to build.

## Core Idea
**Marginal Analysis:** Decisions are made at the margin. You don't ask "Should I eat food?" You ask "Should I eat *one more* slice of pizza?" You stop when the marginal benefit equals the marginal cost.

## Formal Definition (if applicable)
**Opportunity Cost:** The value of the next-best alternative foregone. The cost of going to college isn't just tuition; it's also the wages you didn't earn by working instead.

## Intuition
Life is a series of trade-offs. Resources (time, money) are scarce. Microeconomics provides a framework for making the best possible choices given those constraints.

## Examples
- **Monopoly:** One seller controls the market (e.g., local utility company).
- **Oligopoly:** A few sellers dominate (e.g., Coke and Pepsi).
- **Externalities:** When a transaction affects a third party (e.g., pollution).

## Common Misconceptions
- "Economics is just about money." (It's about choice and incentives. You can use microeconomics to study dating, crime, or voting.)
- "People are always rational." (Behavioral economics shows we often make irrational choices.)

## Related Concepts
- **Utility:** A measure of satisfaction or happiness.
- **Production Possibility Frontier:** A curve showing the maximum output combinations of two goods.
- **Public Goods:** Goods that are non-excludable and non-rivalrous (e.g., national defense).

## Applications
- **Pricing Strategy:** Price discrimination (charging different prices to different people, like airline tickets).
- **Regulation:** Breaking up monopolies (antitrust).
- **Environmental Policy:** Carbon taxes to internalize externalities.

## Criticism / Limitations
Models often rely on simplifying assumptions (like "Homo economicus") that don't perfectly reflect complex human behavior.
