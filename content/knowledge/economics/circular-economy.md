  A circular economy is an economic system aimed at eliminating waste and the continual use of resources. Circular systems employ reuse, sharing, repair, refurbishment, remanufacturing and recycling to create a closed-loop system, minimizing the use of resource inputs and the creation of waste, pollution and carbon emissions.

## Overview
Our current economy is Linear: **Take -> Make -> Waste**. We dig up oil, make plastic, use it once, and throw it in the ocean. A Circular Economy is: **Make -> Use -> Return**. Nothing is waste. Everything is food for the next cycle.

## Core Idea
The core idea is **Design out Waste**. Waste is a design flaw. If a phone can't be repaired, it was designed badly.

## Formal Definition
An economic system aimed at eliminating waste and the continual use of resources.
**The Butterfly Diagram:** Biological nutrients (food) go back to the soil. Technical nutrients (metal) go back to the factory.

## Intuition
-   **Nature:** There is no landfill in a forest. A dead leaf becomes soil for a tree.
-   **Circular Economy:** Mimicking nature. Your old jeans become insulation for a house. Your old car becomes a new car.

## Examples
-   **Product as a Service:** You don't buy a lightbulb; you buy "Light." Philips owns the bulb. When it breaks, they take it back and fix it. They have an incentive to make a bulb that lasts forever.
-   **Patagonia:** "Don't Buy This Jacket." They repair your old clothes for free so you don't have to buy new ones.
-   **Fairphone:** A modular smartphone. You can replace the camera or battery yourself with a screwdriver.

## Common Misconceptions
-   **It's just recycling:** Recycling is the *last* resort. It takes energy. The goal is Repair, Reuse, and Remanufacture first.

## Related Concepts
-   **Cradle to Cradle:** Designing products that are 100% safe and recyclable.
-   **Planned Obsolescence:** The enemy. Designing things to break after 2 years so you have to buy a new one.

## Applications
-   **Fashion:** The fashion industry is the second biggest polluter. Circular fashion (renting clothes, reselling) is trying to fix this.

## Criticism / Limitations
-   **Cost:** It is currently cheaper to dig up new plastic than to collect and clean old plastic. We need to change the incentives (taxes).
