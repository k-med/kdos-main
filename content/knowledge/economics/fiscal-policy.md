## Overview
The government has two levers to steer the economy: Monetary Policy (Interest Rates) and Fiscal Policy (Taxes and Spending). Fiscal Policy is the power of the purse. It is Congress deciding to build a bridge or cut taxes to create jobs.

## Core Idea
The core idea is **Aggregate Demand**. The total amount of spending in the economy.
-   **Recession:** People are scared, so they stop spending. Businesses fire people.
-   **Solution (Keynesian):** The government should step in and spend money (Stimulus) to fill the gap. "Prime the pump."

## Formal Definition
The use of government spending and tax policies to influence economic conditions.
**Expansionary:** Lower taxes, higher spending (Gas pedal).
**Contractionary:** Higher taxes, lower spending (Brake).

## Intuition
-   **Family Budget:** If a family is broke, they spend less.
-   **Government Budget:** If the economy is broke, the government should spend *more*. It's counter-intuitive. The government acts as the "Spender of Last Resort."

## Examples
-   **The New Deal (1930s):** FDR hired millions of unemployed people to build roads, dams, and parks. It put money in their pockets, which they spent at grocery stores, which hired more people.
-   **COVID Stimulus Checks (2020):** The government sent checks to everyone to keep the economy from collapsing during the lockdown.
-   **Austerity:** The opposite. Cutting spending during a crisis. (Greece in 2010). Most economists now think this makes things worse.

## Common Misconceptions
-   **The Deficit:** "The government is running out of money." A country that prints its own currency (USA, Japan) cannot "run out" of money. The limit is inflation, not bankruptcy.

## Related Concepts
-   **Multiplier Effect:** If the government spends $1, it creates $1.50 of economic activity because the construction worker spends his wages at the bar, and the bartender spends his tips at the store.
-   **Crowding Out:** If the government borrows too much, it uses up all the available loan money, making it harder for businesses to borrow.

## Applications
-   **Infrastructure Bill:** Spending $1 Trillion on bridges and internet. It creates jobs now and makes the economy more efficient later.

## Criticism / Limitations
-   **Lag:** By the time Congress agrees on a stimulus bill, the recession might already be over.
