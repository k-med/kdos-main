  Inflation is a general rise in the price level of an economy over a period of time. When the general price level rises, each unit of currency buys fewer goods and services; consequently, inflation reflects a reduction in the purchasing power per unit of money.

## Overview
Grandpa always says, "In my day, a movie ticket cost a nickel." Now it costs $15. That is inflation. It is the invisible thief that makes your money worth less every year. It is why you need a raise just to stay in the same place.

## Core Idea
The core idea is **Too Much Money Chasing Too Few Goods**. If everyone suddenly became a millionaire overnight, but the number of houses and cars stayed the same, the price of houses and cars would skyrocket.

## Formal Definition
A sustained increase in the general price level of goods and services in an economy over a period of time.
**CPI (Consumer Price Index):** The "basket of goods" (milk, gas, rent) used to measure inflation.

## Intuition
-   **The Balloon:** The economy is a balloon. Money is the air. If you blow too much air (print money) into the balloon, it expands (prices go up). If you blow too much, it pops (Hyperinflation).

## Examples
-   **Germany (1923):** Hyperinflation. Prices doubled every 3 days. People brought wheelbarrows of cash to buy bread. Kids used stacks of money as building blocks because it was cheaper than toys.
-   **Zimbabwe (2008):** They printed a 100 Trillion Dollar bill. It wasn't enough to buy a bus ticket.
-   **The Fed:** The Federal Reserve's main job is to keep inflation at exactly 2%. Not 0%, not 10%, but 2%. A little bit of inflation encourages people to spend money now (before it loses value), which helps the economy grow.

## Common Misconceptions
-   **Inflation is always bad:** Deflation (falling prices) is actually worse. If prices are falling, you wait to buy a car because it will be cheaper tomorrow. If everyone waits, the economy freezes (The Great Depression).

## Related Concepts
-   **Purchasing Power:** How many Big Macs you can buy with $100.
-   **Stagflation:** The nightmare scenario. High inflation + High unemployment. (The 1970s).

## Applications
-   **Investing:** If inflation is 3% and your bank account pays 0.1%, you are losing money. You need to invest in stocks or real estate to beat inflation.

## Criticism / Limitations
-   **Shrinkflation:** Companies keeping the price the same ($5) but making the bag of chips smaller. It's hidden inflation.
