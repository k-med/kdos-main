  The Phillips curve is an economic concept developed by A. W. Phillips stating that inflation and unemployment have a stable and inverse relationship. The theory claims that with economic growth comes inflation, which in turn should lead to more jobs and less unemployment.

## Overview
It's the cruelest trade-off in economics. You can have low unemployment, or you can have low inflation. You can't have both. If everyone has a job, they spend money, prices go up (Inflation). If you want to stop inflation, you have to slow the economy, and people lose their jobs.

## Core Idea
The core idea is **The Inverse Relationship**.
-   Unemployment Down -> Inflation Up.
-   Unemployment Up -> Inflation Down.

## Formal Definition
A single-equation economic model, describing an inverse relationship between rates of unemployment and corresponding rates of rises in wages that result within an economy.

## Intuition
-   **The Boom:** Everyone is hiring. Bosses have to raise wages to attract workers. Workers spend those wages. Prices go up.
-   **The Bust:** No one is hiring. Workers are desperate. They accept lower wages. Prices stay low.

## Examples
-   **The 1960s:** The curve worked perfectly. Policy makers thought they could "dial in" the exact mix of inflation and unemployment they wanted.
-   **The 1970s (Stagflation):** The curve broke. We had High Inflation AND High Unemployment. It turned out the curve isn't stable in the long run.

## Common Misconceptions
-   **It's a law of nature:** It's just a correlation that holds in the short run. In the long run, money is neutral. Printing money just creates inflation without lowering unemployment.

## Related Concepts
-   **NAIRU:** Non-Accelerating Inflation Rate of Unemployment. The "natural" rate of unemployment (around 4-5%). If you try to push unemployment below this, you just get hyperinflation.

## Applications
-   **The Fed:** They still use the Phillips Curve framework. When unemployment gets too low, they raise interest rates to cool things down before inflation starts.

## Criticism / Limitations
-   **Expectations:** If people *expect* inflation, they demand higher wages immediately, which causes inflation without lowering unemployment. (Rational Expectations).
