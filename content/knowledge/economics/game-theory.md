  Game theory is the study of mathematical models of strategic interaction among rational decision-makers. It has applications in all fields of social science, as well as in logic, systems science and computer science.

## Overview
Life is a game. Your success depends not just on what you do, but on what *others* do. Game theory analyzes these strategic interactions, from poker to nuclear war.

## Core Idea
**Nash Equilibrium:** A situation where no player can benefit by changing their strategy while the other players keep theirs unchanged. It's a state of "no regrets."

## Formal Definition (if applicable)
**Prisoner's Dilemma:** A standard example where two rational individuals might not cooperate, even if it appears that it is in their best interest to do so.
- If both cooperate: 1 year jail each.
- If one betrays: 0 years for betrayer, 3 years for cooperator.
- If both betray: 2 years jail each.
Nash Equilibrium: Both betray (and get a worse outcome than if they cooperated).

## Intuition
Imagine two drivers at an intersection.
- If both go: Crash (Bad).
- If both stop: Wait (Okay).
- If one goes and one stops: Smooth traffic (Good).
Game theory helps predict what will happen.

## Examples
- **Cold War:** Mutually Assured Destruction (MAD) was a Nash Equilibrium.
- **Auctions:** Designing rules to get people to bid their true value.
- **Evolutionary Biology:** Hawk-Dove game explaining animal aggression.

## Common Misconceptions
- "It's about winning games." (It's about understanding *strategy* in any interaction.)
- "Rational means selfish." (You can have altruistic preferences in game theory.)

## Related Concepts
- **Zero-Sum Game:** One person's gain is another's loss (Poker).
- **Non-Zero-Sum Game:** Win-win or lose-lose is possible (Trade).
- **Coordination Game:** Players benefit from choosing the same option (Driving on the right side of the road).

## Applications
- **Economics:** Oligopoly pricing.
- **Political Science:** Voting systems and international treaties.
- **Computer Science:** Network routing and AI.

## Criticism / Limitations
Assumes players are perfectly rational and have infinite computing power, which real humans do not.
