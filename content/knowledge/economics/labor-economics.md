## Overview
Most of us trade our time for money. Labor economics studies this exchange. It asks: Why do doctors earn more than janitors? Does the minimum wage kill jobs? Why is there a gender pay gap?

## Core Idea
**Marginal Revenue Product of Labor (MRPL):** A firm will hire a worker as long as the value of what they produce is greater than their wage.

## Formal Definition (if applicable)
**Human Capital Theory:** Education and training are investments that increase a worker's productivity and thus their future wages.

## Intuition
The labor market is a market like any other, but the "commodity" is human time.
- **Supply:** You (workers).
- **Demand:** Companies.
- **Price:** Wage.

## Examples
- **Minimum Wage:** A price floor on labor.
- **Unions:** A cartel of workers bargaining for higher wages (monopoly power).
- **Gig Economy:** Uber/DoorDash changing the nature of employment.

## Common Misconceptions
- "Immigrants steal jobs." (Lump of Labor Fallacy: There isn't a fixed number of jobs. Immigrants also consume goods, creating demand for new jobs.)
- "Robots will take all our jobs." (Technology destroys some jobs but creates others. The challenge is transition.)

## Related Concepts
- **Frictional Unemployment:** Time spent looking for a job.
- **Structural Unemployment:** Mismatch between skills and jobs.
- **Monopsony:** A market with only one buyer (e.g., a factory town where everyone works for the same company).

## Applications
- **HR:** Compensation and hiring strategies.
- **Public Policy:** Education, immigration, and welfare reform.
- **Personal Career:** Deciding whether to go to grad school.

## Criticism / Limitations
Labor markets are not perfectly competitive. Discrimination, social norms, and power dynamics play a huge role.
