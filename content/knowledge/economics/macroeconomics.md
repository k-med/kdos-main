## Overview
Macroeconomics looks at the big picture: growth, inflation, and unemployment. It asks why economies boom and bust, and what governments can do about it.

## Core Idea
**Aggregate Demand and Supply:** Just like supply and demand for a single product, but for *everything* produced in a country.
**GDP (Gross Domestic Product):** The total value of all goods and services produced.

## Formal Definition (if applicable)
**Fiscal Policy:** Government use of spending and taxation to influence the economy (Congress/Parliament).
**Monetary Policy:** Central bank management of money supply and interest rates (The Fed).

## Intuition
The economy is like a car.
- **GDP:** Speed.
- **Unemployment:** Engine sputtering.
- **Inflation:** Overheating.
- **Fiscal/Monetary Policy:** The gas pedal and brakes used to keep the car driving smoothly.

## Examples
- **The Great Depression:** A massive failure of aggregate demand.
- **Hyperinflation:** When money loses value rapidly (e.g., Zimbabwe, Weimar Germany).
- **The 2008 Financial Crisis:** A collapse in the housing market triggering a global recession.

## Common Misconceptions
- "Government debt is like household debt." (Governments can print money and live forever; households cannot.)
- "Saving is always good." (Paradox of Thrift: If everyone saves, no one spends, and the economy crashes.)

## Related Concepts
- **Keynesian Economics:** The view that government intervention is necessary to stabilize the economy.
- **Supply-Side Economics:** The view that cutting taxes and regulation drives growth.
- **Business Cycle:** The natural rise and fall of economic growth over time.

## Applications
- **Central Banking:** Setting interest rates to control inflation.
- **Government Budgeting:** Deciding how much to tax and spend.
- **Investment:** Understanding the economic climate.

## Criticism / Limitations
Macroeconomic forecasting is notoriously difficult. "Economists have predicted nine of the last five recessions."
