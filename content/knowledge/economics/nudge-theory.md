## Overview
Humans are lazy. We usually choose the default option. Nudge Theory says: "If we change the default, we can change the world." It is about influencing people's decisions without forcing them.

## Core Idea
The core idea is **Libertarian Paternalism**.
-   **Libertarian:** You are free to choose whatever you want.
-   **Paternalism:** We will design the choices to guide you toward what is good for you (health, wealth).

## Formal Definition
A concept in behavioral economics that proposes positive reinforcement and indirect suggestions as ways to influence the behavior and decision making of groups or individuals.
**Choice Architecture:** The design of the environment in which people make choices.

## Intuition
-   **The Cafeteria:** If you put the apples at eye level and the cake on the bottom shelf, people buy more apples. You didn't ban the cake; you just "nudged" them.
-   **The Urinal:** Painting a fly on the urinal. Men aim at the fly. Spillage is reduced by 80%. A perfect nudge.

## Examples
-   **Organ Donation:**
    -   Country A (Opt-In): "Check this box to be a donor." Rate: 15%.
    -   Country B (Opt-Out): "Check this box NOT to be a donor." Rate: 99%.
    -   The default option saves thousands of lives.
-   **401(k) Savings:** Automatically enrolling employees in a retirement plan (with the option to opt-out) increases savings rates dramatically.

## Common Misconceptions
-   **It's manipulation:** It is. But *every* design is manipulation. There is no "neutral" design. You have to put the apples *somewhere*.
-   **It solves everything:** Nudges are weak. They can't fix poverty or climate change. They are just a cheap way to improve efficiency.

## Related Concepts
-   **Behavioral Economics:** The science behind Nudge. (Kahneman and Tversky).
-   **Sludge:** The evil twin. Designing choices to make things harder (e.g., Making it impossible to cancel a subscription).

## Applications
-   **Public Policy:** The UK and US governments have "Nudge Units" (Behavioral Insights Teams) to improve tax collection and public health.

## Criticism / Limitations
-   **Ethics:** Who decides what is "good" for you? Is it right for the government to trick you into eating apples?
