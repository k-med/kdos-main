## Overview
Why are some countries rich and others poor? Development economics tries to answer this trillion-dollar question. It's not just about money; it's about health, education, and freedom.

## Core Idea
**Institutions:** The rules of the game. Countries with inclusive institutions (property rights, rule of law, democracy) tend to prosper. Countries with extractive institutions (corruption, dictatorship) tend to fail.

## Formal Definition (if applicable)
**Human Capital:** The stock of habits, knowledge, social and personality attributes embodied in the ability to perform labor so as to produce economic value (e.g., education, health).

## Intuition
Giving a man a fish feeds him for a day. Teaching him to fish feeds him for a lifetime. But what if he has no fishing rod (capital)? What if the lake is polluted (environment)? What if a warlord steals his fish (politics)? Development is complex.

## Examples
- **Microfinance:** Small loans to the poor to start businesses (e.g., Grameen Bank).
- **Conditional Cash Transfers:** Giving money to poor families *if* they send their kids to school.
- **The Resource Curse:** Countries with abundant natural resources often have less economic growth and worse development outcomes.

## Common Misconceptions
- "Foreign aid is the solution." (Aid can help, but it can also fuel corruption and dependency if not managed well.)
- "Poor people are lazy." (The poor are often incredibly hardworking entrepreneurs, just trapped in bad systems.)

## Related Concepts
- **Poverty Trap:** Mechanisms that make it very difficult for people to escape poverty.
- **Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs):** UN goals to end poverty and protect the planet.
- **Gini Coefficient:** A measure of inequality.

## Applications
- **NGOs:** Designing effective interventions.
- **World Bank / IMF:** Lending and policy advice.
- **Government:** Education and health policy.

## Criticism / Limitations
One-size-fits-all solutions (like the "Washington Consensus") often fail because they ignore local context and culture.
