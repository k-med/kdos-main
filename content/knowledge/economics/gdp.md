## Overview
How do you keep score in the game of nations? GDP (Gross Domestic Product). It is the total price tag of everything a country produces in a year. Every haircut, every car, every apple. It is the most watched number in the world.

## Core Idea
The core idea is **Production = Income**. Every dollar spent by someone is a dollar earned by someone else. So GDP measures both the total spending and the total income of the nation.

## Formal Definition
The market value of all final goods and services produced within a country in a given period.
Formula: $Y = C + I + G + (X - M)$
(Consumption + Investment + Government Spending + Net Exports).

## Intuition
-   **The Pie:** GDP is the size of the economic pie.
-   **GDP Per Capita:** The size of the slice each person gets. (GDP / Population). This is a better measure of how rich a country feels.

## Examples
-   **USA:** ~$23 Trillion. The biggest economy.
-   **China:** ~$18 Trillion. Catching up fast.
-   **Luxembourg:** Tiny GDP, but huge GDP Per Capita ($130k). They are rich.

## Common Misconceptions
-   **GDP measures happiness:** No. If you crash your car, GDP goes *up* (because you pay the mechanic and the hospital). It measures activity, not well-being.
-   **Stay-at-home moms:** Their work (cooking, cleaning, childcare) is worth trillions, but it counts as $0 in GDP because no money changes hands.

## Related Concepts
-   **Real GDP:** GDP adjusted for inflation. (If prices double but production stays the same, Nominal GDP doubles, but Real GDP is flat).
-   **GNP (Gross National Product):** Measures what Americans produce, even if they are in France. GDP measures what is produced in America, even if by a French company.

## Applications
-   **Recession:** Defined as 2 quarters of falling GDP.

## Criticism / Limitations
-   **The Environment:** GDP ignores pollution. Cutting down a rainforest increases GDP (selling timber), but destroys the planet.
-   **HDI (Human Development Index):** A better score. It includes GDP plus Life Expectancy and Education.
