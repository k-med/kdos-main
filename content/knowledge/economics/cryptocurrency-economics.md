## Overview
Money used to be gold. Then it was paper backed by gold. Now it is paper backed by nothing (Fiat). Cryptocurrency asks: "What if money was math?" It is an experiment in creating a new financial system without governments or banks.

## Core Idea
The core idea is **Scarcity without Authority**.
-   **Gold:** Scarce because physics. (Hard to mine).
-   **Fiat:** Not scarce. (Government can print more).
-   **Bitcoin:** Scarce because code. (Only 21 million will ever exist).

## Formal Definition
The study of the economic incentives and protocols that secure a decentralized network.
**Tokenomics:** The supply and demand logic of a specific coin.

## Intuition
-   **The Ledger:** Who keeps the score?
    -   **Bank:** A private spreadsheet. You trust the bank.
    -   **Crypto:** A public whiteboard. Everyone watches everyone. You trust the crowd.

## Examples
-   **Bitcoin:** Digital Gold. A store of value. Slow, expensive, but very secure.
-   **Ethereum:** Digital Oil. Fuel for running programs (Smart Contracts).
-   **Stablecoins (USDT):** Crypto that is pegged to the Dollar. It tries to be boring.

## Common Misconceptions
-   **It has no intrinsic value:** Neither does a $100 bill. It's just paper. Value comes from *belief*. If people believe Bitcoin is worth $50k, then it is.
-   **It's a Ponzi Scheme:** A Ponzi scheme requires a central operator. Crypto is a bubble (maybe), but not a Ponzi.

## Related Concepts
-   **Deflationary Currency:** Since the supply of Bitcoin is fixed, if the economy grows, the price *must* go up. This encourages hoarding (HODLing) instead of spending.
-   **Gresham's Law:** "Bad money drives out good." If you have a Dollar (bad/inflating) and a Bitcoin (good/deflating), you spend the Dollar and save the Bitcoin.

## Applications
-   **Remittances:** Sending money to family in another country. Western Union takes 10%. Crypto takes $1.

## Criticism / Limitations
-   **Volatility:** You can't buy coffee with Bitcoin if the price drops 20% while you are standing in line.
-   **Energy:** Mining Bitcoin uses as much electricity as Sweden.
