  Consumer theory is the study of how people decide to spend their money based on their individual preferences and budget constraints. A branch of microeconomics, consumer theory shows how individuals make choices subject to how much income they have available to spend and the prices of goods and services.

## Overview
Why do you buy Coke instead of Pepsi? Why do you buy a house instead of renting? Consumer Theory tries to explain every shopping decision you make. It assumes you are a rational robot trying to get the maximum happiness (Utility) for the minimum money.

## Core Idea
The core idea is **Utility Maximization**.
-   **Utility:** A measure of happiness. (Utils).
-   **Budget Constraint:** You only have $100.
-   **Goal:** Spend the $100 in a way that gives you the most Utils.

## Formal Definition
The study of how individuals make choices subject to budget constraints.
**Indifference Curve:** A line showing all the combinations of Pizza and Beer that make you equally happy.

## Intuition
-   **Diminishing Marginal Utility:** The first slice of pizza is heaven (100 Utils). The second is good (50 Utils). The tenth makes you sick (-10 Utils). This is why you don't spend all your money on pizza. You switch to beer when the marginal utility of pizza drops below the marginal utility of beer.

## Examples
-   **Substitution Effect:** If the price of Coffee goes up, you buy Tea.
-   **Income Effect:** If your rent goes down, you feel richer, so you buy more Coffee *and* Tea.
-   **Giffen Good:** A weird exception. If the price of bread goes up, poor people buy *more* bread. Why? Because they can no longer afford meat, so they have to eat bread to survive.

## Common Misconceptions
-   **People are rational:** Behavioral Economics proves we are not. We buy things on impulse, we are bad at math, and we care about fairness. Consumer Theory is a "Spherical Cow" model—useful but not perfectly realistic.

## Related Concepts
-   **Revealed Preference:** Don't listen to what people *say* ("I want to eat healthy"). Watch what they *do* (Buy donuts). Actions reveal true preferences.

## Applications
-   **Marketing:** Companies use this to price products. "Buy one get one free" exploits your desire to maximize utility.

## Criticism / Limitations
-   **Bounded Rationality:** We don't have the brainpower to calculate the utility of every item in the grocery store. We use shortcuts (Heuristics).
