## Overview
Karl Marx wasn't just a revolutionary; he was an economist. He analyzed Capitalism and predicted it would destroy itself. He argued that profit is theft—it is the unpaid labor of the worker.

## Core Idea
The core idea is **Exploitation**.
1.  Worker makes a chair in 4 hours.
2.  Capitalist sells the chair for $100.
3.  Capitalist pays the worker $20.
4.  Capitalist keeps $80 (Surplus Value).
Marx asked: "Why does the Capitalist get $80 just for owning the factory?"

## Formal Definition
A school of thought focusing on the role of labor and class struggle.
**Labor Theory of Value:** The value of a commodity is determined by the amount of socially necessary labor time required to produce it.

## Intuition
-   **Feudalism:** Lord and Serf. The Lord takes the harvest because he has a sword.
-   **Capitalism:** Boss and Worker. The Boss takes the profit because he has a contract. Marx said it's the same thing, just hidden better.

## Examples
-   **Alienation:** The worker doesn't own the chair he made. He just sells his time. He becomes a cog in a machine.
-   **Crisis of Overproduction:** Workers are paid so little they can't afford to buy the things they make. The warehouses fill up, prices crash, and the economy collapses.

## Common Misconceptions
-   **Marx hated technology:** No, he admired it. He just thought it should benefit everyone, not just the factory owner.
-   **Communism = USSR:** Marx wrote about *Capitalism*. He wrote very little about how Communism should actually work. The USSR was Lenin's interpretation.

## Related Concepts
-   **Historical Materialism:** The idea that history is driven by economics, not ideas. "The hand-mill gives you society with the feudal lord; the steam-mill, society with the industrial capitalist."

## Applications
-   **Unions:** The labor movement is based on the idea that workers need to band together to fight for their share of the surplus value.

## Criticism / Limitations
-   **The Transformation Problem:** The Labor Theory of Value doesn't really work mathematically. Prices are determined by Supply and Demand, not just labor time. (e.g., A mud pie takes 10 hours to make but is worth $0).
