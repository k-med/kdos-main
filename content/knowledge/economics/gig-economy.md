## Overview
The 9-to-5 job is dying. In the Gig Economy, you don't have a boss; you have an App. You are an "Independent Contractor." You drive for Uber, deliver for DoorDash, and design logos on Fiverr. It offers freedom, but it takes away security.

## Core Idea
The core idea is **On-Demand Labor**. Just like Cloud Computing lets you rent a server by the second, the Gig Economy lets you rent a human by the task.

## Formal Definition
A labor market characterized by the prevalence of short-term contracts or freelance work as opposed to permanent jobs.

## Intuition
-   **Employee:** A marriage. Long-term commitment. Benefits. Hard to fire.
-   **Gig Worker:** A Tinder date. One night only. No strings attached.

## Examples
-   **Uber/Lyft:** The giants. They argue they are just "tech platforms" connecting drivers and riders, not transportation companies.
-   **Upwork:** White-collar gigs. Programmers and writers bidding for projects.
-   **TaskRabbit:** "I need someone to assemble my IKEA furniture."

## Common Misconceptions
-   **It's just for side hustles:** For millions of people, it is their full-time job.
-   **You are your own boss:** Technically yes, but the Algorithm is the real boss. If your rating drops below 4.6 stars, you get fired (deactivated) by a robot.

## Related Concepts
-   **Precariat:** A new social class. People living in a state of precariousness. No health insurance, no sick leave, no retirement.
-   **Algorithmic Management:** Being managed by software.

## Applications
-   **Flexibility:** It allows parents or students to work whenever they want.

## Criticism / Limitations
-   **Exploitation:** Gig companies shift all the risk (car maintenance, gas, insurance) onto the worker. They avoid paying payroll taxes.
-   **AB5 (California Law):** An attempt to force Uber to classify drivers as employees. It is a huge legal battle.
