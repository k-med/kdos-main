  Supply and demand is an economic model of price determination in a market. It postulates that, holding all else equal, in a competitive market, the unit price for a particular good will vary until it settles at a point where the quantity demanded equals the quantity supplied.

## Overview
This is the most famous diagram in economics: two intersecting lines that explain why diamonds are expensive and water is cheap (usually). It describes how buyers and sellers interact to determine prices.

## Core Idea
**Equilibrium:** The point where the Supply curve (sellers) and Demand curve (buyers) cross. At this price, everyone who wants to buy can buy, and everyone who wants to sell can sell.

## Formal Definition (if applicable)
**Law of Demand:** As price increases, quantity demanded decreases.
**Law of Supply:** As price increases, quantity supplied increases.

## Intuition
Imagine a concert. If tickets are $1, everyone wants one (high demand), but the band won't play (low supply). If tickets are $10,000, the band will play all night (high supply), but no one will buy (low demand). Somewhere in the middle ($100), the arena is full.

## Examples
- **Gas Prices:** When oil supply drops (war, disaster), gas prices rise to ration the limited supply.
- **Clearance Sales:** When a store has too much inventory (surplus), they lower the price to increase demand.
- **Uber Surge Pricing:** Increasing price during high demand to encourage more drivers (supply) to get on the road.

## Common Misconceptions
- "Price is set by costs." (Price is set by what people are willing to pay, not just what it cost to make.)
- "Demand is a fixed number." (Demand is a curve; it changes depending on price.)

## Related Concepts
- **Elasticity:** How sensitive demand is to price changes (e.g., insulin is inelastic; luxury cars are elastic).
- **Shortage:** When price is too low ($Q_d > Q_s$).
- **Surplus:** When price is too high ($Q_s > Q_d$).

## Applications
- **Business Strategy:** Setting the right price for a product.
- **Public Policy:** Understanding the impact of taxes or price controls (minimum wage, rent control).
- **Investing:** Predicting commodity price movements.

## Criticism / Limitations
The model assumes "perfect competition" (many buyers/sellers, identical products), which rarely exists in the real world (monopolies, branding).
