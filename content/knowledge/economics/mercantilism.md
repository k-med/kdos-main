## Overview
Before Capitalism, there was Mercantilism. The idea was: "Wealth is Gold." To get rich, a country must sell (export) more than it buys (import), and pile up the gold in the King's vault. This led to wars, colonization, and slavery. Adam Smith wrote *The Wealth of Nations* specifically to destroy this idea.

## Core Idea
The core idea is **Trade is Zero-Sum**. If I win, you lose.
-   **Mercantilism:** We must crush our rivals and take their gold.
-   **Capitalism:** We can both trade and both get rich.

## Formal Definition
An economic policy designed to maximize the exports and minimize the imports for an economy.
Dominant in Europe from the 16th to the 18th century.

## Intuition
-   **The Hoarder:** Imagine a guy who sells everything he owns and fills his house with cash. He is "rich" in money, but he has no bed, no food, and no friends. That is a Mercantilist country.
-   **The Consumer:** Real wealth is *stuff* (houses, food, cars), not gold.

## Examples
-   **The British Empire:** They forbade the American colonies from trading with France. The colonies had to sell cotton to England (cheap) and buy cloth from England (expensive). This caused the American Revolution.
-   **China (Modern):** Some accuse China of "Neo-Mercantilism." Keeping their currency cheap to boost exports and hoarding US Dollars.

## Common Misconceptions
-   **Trade Deficits are bad:** Trump argued this. "We have a deficit with China, so we are losing." Economists say: "No, we get cheap iPhones, they get green pieces of paper. We are winning."

## Related Concepts
-   **Protectionism:** Tariffs and quotas. The tools of Mercantilism.
-   **Bullionism:** The obsession with gold and silver.

## Applications
-   **Trade Wars:** When countries start raising tariffs to hurt each other.

## Criticism / Limitations
-   **It works for a while:** It helped England become a superpower. But eventually, it leads to inflation and war.
