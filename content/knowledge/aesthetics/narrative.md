## Overview
Narrative is more than just a story; it is a structure for organizing information. From novels and movies to history books and personal identities, narrative provides the framework of "beginning, middle, and end."

## Core Idea
Narratives are constructed through the selection and arrangement of events (**plot**) involving agents (**characters**) within a specific setting. The way a story is told (discourse) is as important as what happens (story).

## Formal Definition (if applicable)
Aristotle defined the essential element of narrative (mythos) as the "arrangement of the incidents," emphasizing that a whole must have a beginning, a middle, and an end.

## Intuition
We naturally tell stories to explain our day ("First I did this, then that happened..."). This impulse to create causal links between events is the narrative instinct.

## Examples
- **The Hero's Journey:** A universal narrative pattern found in myths and movies worldwide.
- **History:** The construction of a coherent story from past events.
- **Identity:** The "story of my life" that we tell ourselves and others.

## Common Misconceptions
- "Narrative is just for fiction." (History, journalism, and even scientific theories often rely on narrative structures.)
- "Plot is the same as story." (Story is the chronological sequence of events; plot is how they are presented to the reader.)

## Related Concepts
- **Mimesis:** Representation of reality.
- **Diegesis:** The telling of a story.
- **Hermeneutics:** The theory of interpretation.

## Applications
- **Marketing:** Brand storytelling to connect with customers.
- **Psychology:** Narrative therapy helps patients re-author their life stories.
- **Law:** Constructing a compelling narrative of events for a jury.

## Criticism / Limitations
Postmodernists criticize "grand narratives" (like Progress or Enlightenment) for oversimplifying complex realities and excluding marginalized voices.
