## Overview
Aesthetic judgment is the mental faculty by which we evaluate beauty, sublimity, or artistic merit. Unlike logical judgments (which rely on concepts and facts) or moral judgments (which rely on rules of conduct), aesthetic judgments are based on *feeling*—specifically, the feeling of pleasure or displeasure. The central philosophical problem, most famously explored by Immanuel Kant in his *Critique of Judgment* (1790), is how a judgment based on subjective feeling can claim to be valid for everyone.

## Core Idea
The core paradox of aesthetic judgment is that it feels personal ("I like this") but speaks with a universal voice ("This is beautiful"). When we say something is beautiful, we are not just reporting a private sensation (like saying "I like the taste of coffee"); we are implying that others *ought* to find it beautiful too. This demand for universal agreement, despite the lack of objective rules, is what makes aesthetic judgment unique.

## Formal Definition
For Kant, a pure judgment of taste must be **disinterested**. This means it must be free from any desire for the object, any interest in its existence, or any moral or practical purpose. We judge the form of the object solely for the "free play" of our cognitive faculties (imagination and understanding). If we enjoy a painting because we want to own it, or because it depicts a moral lesson, that is not a pure aesthetic judgment.

## Intuition
Imagine looking at a sunset. You don't want to eat it, you don't want to sell it, and it doesn't "do" anything useful. You simply enjoy the experience of looking at it. That is a disinterested pleasure. Now imagine looking at a picture of a delicious meal when you are hungry. Your pleasure is interested—it is driven by appetite. Aesthetic judgment requires that first kind of detached, contemplative pleasure.

## Examples
-   **"This flower is beautiful":** A classic aesthetic judgment. It claims universal validity based on the form of the flower.
-   **"This wine is agreeable":** A judgment of the agreeable. It is purely personal; you don't expect everyone to like the same wine.
-   **"This action is good":** A moral judgment. It is based on a concept of duty or utility, not just the immediate feeling of the form.

## Common Misconceptions
-   **"Beauty is in the eye of the beholder":** While the *feeling* is in the beholder, Kant argues that the *judgment* claims to be universal. We argue about taste precisely because we believe there is a standard, even if we can't prove it.
-   **It's about being a snob:** Aesthetic judgment isn't about knowing the "right" answers; it's about the capacity to engage with an object freely, without practical or selfish concerns.

## Related Concepts
-   **[Taste](/knowledge/aesthetics/taste/):** The faculty of judging the beautiful. Aesthetic judgment is the exercise of taste.
-   **The Sublime:** A different kind of aesthetic judgment involving awe and boundlessness, rather than the harmonious form of the beautiful.
-   **Subjective Universality:** The specific logical status of aesthetic judgments—subjective in origin (feeling) but universal in scope (demanding agreement).

## Applications
-   **Art Criticism:** Critics use aesthetic judgment to evaluate works, attempting to articulate why a work succeeds or fails beyond mere personal preference.
-   **Curating:** Museum curators make aesthetic judgments about what is worthy of preservation and display.
-   **Environmental Aesthetics:** Applying aesthetic judgment to nature and environments, raising questions about whether "disinterestedness" applies when we are ecologically connected to the landscape.

## Criticism / Limitations
-   **Pierre Bourdieu:** Argued that the "pure gaze" of disinterested aesthetic judgment is a myth and a marker of class privilege. Only those free from economic necessity can afford to be "disinterested."
-   **Feminist Aesthetics:** Critics argue that the traditional concept of aesthetic judgment is gendered, privileging a detached, "male" gaze over embodied or emotional engagement.
-   **Cultural Relativism:** Kant's claim to universality is often criticized as projecting 18th-century European values onto the rest of the world.
