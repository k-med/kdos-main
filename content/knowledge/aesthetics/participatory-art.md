## Overview
Participatory Art challenges the traditional "passive" role of the viewer. Instead of standing back and looking at a painting, the audience is asked to eat, talk, touch, or co-create. The "art" is not the object, but the relationship between people. It emerged strongly in the 1990s, often described by Nicolas Bourriaud as "Relational Aesthetics."

## Core Idea
The core idea is **collaboration**. The artist is no longer a solitary genius creating a masterpiece; they are a facilitator or conductor of social experiences. The goal is often to create a temporary community or a "micro-utopia" within the gallery space.

## Formal Definition
It is art that takes human relations and their social context as its theoretical and practical point of departure. It prioritizes **intersubjectivity** (the shared experience) over private contemplation.

## Intuition
Imagine walking into a gallery. Instead of paintings on the wall, there is a kitchen where the artist is cooking curry and serving it to visitors (Rirkrit Tiravanija). You sit down, eat, and talk to strangers. The art is the conversation and the shared meal. It breaks down the barrier between "art" and "life."

## Examples
-   **Rirkrit Tiravanija:** Famous for cooking meals in galleries. He said, "It is not what you see that is important but what takes place between people."
-   **Marina Abramović:** Her piece *The Artist is Present* invited visitors to sit silently opposite her. The art was the intense emotional connection and the gaze shared between artist and participant.
-   **Yoko Ono's *Cut Piece*:** The audience was invited to cut pieces of her clothing off with scissors. It forced the audience to take responsibility for their actions (violence or gentleness).
-   **Thomas Hirschhorn:** Creates "monuments" in public housing estates, hiring residents to help build and run them, turning the art into a community center.

## Common Misconceptions
-   **It's just a party:** Critics argue it's just "hanging out." Proponents argue that in a world of alienation and digital screens, creating a space for genuine face-to-face interaction is a radical aesthetic act.
-   **There is no skill:** The skill lies in orchestrating social dynamics, not in painting or sculpting.

## Related Concepts
-   **Social Sculpture:** Joseph Beuys' concept that society itself is a sculpture that we all shape. "Everyone is an artist."
-   **Happening:** An earlier form of performance art (1960s) that involved audience participation, but was often more chaotic and less focused on community building.
-   **Interactive Art:** Often refers to digital art (pressing buttons), whereas Participatory Art usually implies human-to-human interaction.

## Applications
-   **Community Development:** Participatory art is often used in urban planning and social work to build cohesion in fractured communities.
-   **Education:** It aligns with progressive education models that value active learning and collaboration.

## Criticism / Limitations
-   **Ethical Issues:** Artists can exploit participants (using them as unpaid labor or props) without giving them real agency.
-   **"Zoo" Effect:** Claire Bishop criticizes some relational art for creating "feel-good" interactions that ignore real political conflict, turning social relations into a spectacle for the elite art world.
