  Authenticity in aesthetics refers to the quality of being genuine, original, or true to oneself. It is a central value in modern art, distinguishing the "real" masterpiece from the fake, the copy, or the sell-out.

## Overview
We value the "real thing." We pay millions for a painting by Rembrandt, but almost nothing for a perfect copy. We praise a musician for being "authentic" and criticize them for "selling out." Authenticity is the gold standard of modern aesthetics. It implies a direct connection between the work and the artist's soul, or the work and its historical origin.

## Core Idea
The core idea is **truth**. An authentic work tells the truth—about its maker, its materials, or its history. It is not a lie, a copy, or a manipulation. In the age of mass production and AI, the hunger for the "authentic" (hand-made, local, real) has become even stronger.

## Formal Definition
It can mean:
1.  **Nominal Authenticity:** Is this object actually by the person it claims to be by? (Not a forgery).
2.  **Expressive Authenticity:** Does this work truly reflect the artist's inner self? (Not a pose).
3.  **Cultural Authenticity:** Does this work truly represent a specific culture or tradition? (Not appropriation).

## Intuition
Imagine you buy a vintage leather jacket. It has scratches and smells like old tobacco. It feels "authentic." Now imagine a brand new jacket made to *look* old with fake scratches. It feels "fake" or "kitsch." The physical object might be identical, but the history is different. We value the history.

## Examples
-   **Walter Benjamin's "Aura":** Benjamin argued that original artworks have an "aura"—a unique presence in time and space—that is lost in mechanical reproduction (like a poster of the Mona Lisa).
-   **The Han van Meegeren Forgeries:** He painted fake Vermeers that fooled the experts. When he was caught, the paintings instantly lost their value. They didn't change physically, but they lost their authenticity.
-   **Punk Rock:** A genre obsessed with authenticity. Three chords played with "real" anger are valued more than technical virtuosity played without "soul."

## Common Misconceptions
-   **Authenticity is objective:** It is often a constructed narrative. A "rustic" Italian restaurant in New York is a carefully designed stage set of authenticity.
-   **Copies are worthless:** In some cultures (like traditional Chinese painting), copying the masters is a sign of respect and skill, not a lack of authenticity.

## Related Concepts
-   **[Kitsch](/knowledge/aesthetics/kitsch/):** Kitsch is often defined as the opposite of authentic—it is fake emotion and fake art.
-   **Appropriation:** When an artist takes something "authentic" from another culture, they are often accused of inauthenticity or theft.
-   **Essentialism:** The belief that there is a true, fixed "essence" to a person or culture that must be expressed.

## Applications
-   **Art Market:** The entire economy of the art world relies on the certificate of authenticity.
-   **Tourism:** Tourists seek "authentic" experiences (eating where the locals eat) to avoid the "fake" tourist traps.
-   **Branding:** Companies spend billions trying to appear "authentic" (e.g., "established 1892", "hand-crafted").

## Criticism / Limitations
-   **The "Authenticity Hoax":** Critics argue that in a capitalist society, authenticity is just another marketing gimmick. We buy "authentic" torn jeans from a factory.
-   **Exclusion:** Demands for cultural authenticity can police artists, preventing them from experimenting outside their "tradition."
