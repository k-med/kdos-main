## Overview
Tragedy is one of the oldest and most enduring forms of art. Originating in ancient Greece, it depicts the downfall of a noble character, usually due to a fatal flaw or error in judgment, leading to a disastrous conclusion.

## Core Idea
The paradox of tragedy is that we derive aesthetic pleasure from witnessing suffering. Aristotle argued this is due to **catharsis**—the purgation or purification of emotions like pity and fear.

## Formal Definition (if applicable)
Aristotle defines tragedy as "an imitation of an action that is serious, complete, and of a certain magnitude... through pity and fear effecting the proper purgation of these emotions."

## Intuition
Why do we watch sad movies? It allows us to experience intense emotions in a safe environment, helping us process our own feelings about mortality and failure.

## Examples
- **Oedipus Rex:** The classic Greek tragedy of a man trying to escape his fate, only to fulfill it.
- **Hamlet:** Shakespeare's tragedy of a prince paralyzed by indecision and grief.
- **Breaking Bad:** A modern tragic arc of a man's moral descent due to pride (hubris).

## Common Misconceptions
- "Tragedy just means a sad ending." (True tragedy involves a necessary downfall resulting from the character's own actions and nature, not just bad luck.)
- "The tragic hero must be perfect." (They must be relatable but flawed—"hamartia"—so we can empathize with their fall.)

## Related Concepts
- **Hamartia:** The "tragic flaw" or error in judgment.
- **Hubris:** Excessive pride or self-confidence.
- **The Sublime:** The aesthetic experience of overwhelming greatness, often linked to tragic themes.

## Applications
- **Literary Analysis:** Understanding character arcs and thematic depth.
- **Psychology:** Exploring how we deal with grief and loss.
- **Ethics:** Examining the consequences of moral choices.

## Criticism / Limitations
Some modern critics argue that the classical definition of tragedy is too aristocratic (focusing on kings and princes) and that "tragedy of the common man" (Miller) is more relevant today.
