## Overview
Iconography (literally "image writing") is the science of identifying and interpreting the subject matter in art. While formal analysis focuses on *how* a painting is made (brushstrokes, color, composition), iconography focuses on *what* it means. It involves decoding the symbols, attributes, and stories that would have been familiar to the original audience but may be obscure to us today.

## Core Idea
The core idea is that images are a language. Just as you need to know vocabulary to read a text, you need to know visual conventions to "read" an image. A woman holding a palm branch isn't just a woman with a plant; in Christian art, she is a martyr. A dog isn't just a pet; it is a symbol of fidelity (*fido*).

## Formal Definition
Erwin Panofsky, the father of modern iconography, distinguished three levels of analysis:
1.  **Pre-iconographic description:** Identifying pure forms (e.g., "a man on a cross").
2.  **Iconography (proper):** Connecting forms to themes and concepts (e.g., "The Crucifixion of Jesus").
3.  **Iconology:** Interpreting the intrinsic meaning or cultural symptom of the work (e.g., what this specific Crucifixion tells us about 15th-century Italian theology).

## Intuition
Imagine looking at a meme from 10 years ago. You might see the image (a cat), but if you don't know the "iconography" of internet culture, you won't understand the joke. Similarly, looking at a Renaissance painting without knowing the Bible or Greek mythology is like looking at a meme without knowing the context. Iconography provides that context.

## Examples
-   **Saint Attributes:** St. Peter is identified by keys (keys to heaven). St. Catherine is identified by a wheel (the instrument of her torture). St. Jerome is identified by a lion and a cardinal's hat.
-   **Vanitas:** A skull in a 17th-century Dutch still life is not just a spooky object; it is a *memento mori*, a symbol of the inevitability of death and the vanity of worldly goods.
-   **The Arnolfini Portrait:** The dog represents loyalty, the single candle represents the presence of God, and the shoes removed represent holy ground. Iconography decodes these details to understand the painting as a marriage contract or sacred ceremony.

## Common Misconceptions
-   **It's just "symbol hunting":** While identifying symbols is part of it, true iconography is about understanding the *system* of meaning and how it changes over time.
-   **It ignores style:** Iconography focuses on content, but content and style are often linked. The way a symbol is depicted affects its meaning.

## Related Concepts
-   **Semiotics:** The study of signs and symbols in general (linguistic and visual). Iconography is essentially the semiotics of art history.
-   **Iconoclasm:** The destruction of icons/images. Understanding why images were destroyed requires understanding their iconographic power.
-   **Visual Culture:** A broader field that includes advertising, film, and digital media, often using iconographic methods to analyze modern images.

## Applications
-   **Art Conservation:** Identifying the subject matter can help conservators understand what a damaged section of a painting *should* look like.
-   **Cultural History:** Images often preserve cultural beliefs and practices that are not recorded in texts. Iconography helps historians reconstruct the mental world of the past.
-   **Film Studies:** Analyzing the "iconography" of genres (e.g., the cowboy hat and revolver in Westerns) helps understand narrative conventions.

## Criticism / Limitations
-   **Over-interpretation:** There is a risk of "reading into" every detail, assuming everything is a symbol when sometimes a cigar is just a cigar.
-   **Text-centrism:** Traditional iconography often treats images as puzzles to be solved by finding the right text (Bible, Ovid), potentially ignoring the purely visual or emotional power of the art.
