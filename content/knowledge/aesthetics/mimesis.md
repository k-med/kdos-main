## Overview
Mimesis (Greek for "imitation") is one of the oldest theories in Western aesthetics. It posits that art works by mirroring or representing nature, human actions, and the physical world.

## Core Idea
The value and danger of art have often been judged by its mimetic quality. Plato saw mimesis as a deception (a copy of a copy), while Aristotle viewed it as a natural human instinct for learning and a source of pleasure.

## Formal Definition (if applicable)
Not applicable as a single formal definition, but in literary theory, it refers to the representation of reality, often contrasted with **diegesis** (telling/narrating).

## Intuition
When we say a movie was "realistic" or a portrait "looked just like him," we are praising its mimetic quality. We intuitively understand art as a reflection of life.

## Examples
- **Realist Novel:** A book that describes everyday life with detailed accuracy (e.g., Flaubert).
- **Portraiture:** A painting attempting to capture the exact likeness of a subject.
- **Acting:** An actor "becoming" a character to imitate human behavior.

## Common Misconceptions
- "Mimesis means exact copying." (Aristotle argued mimesis involves representing things as they *ought* to be or *could* be, not just as they are.)
- "Abstract art has no mimesis." (Even abstract art can be seen as imitating internal states or essential forms.)

## Related Concepts
- **Realism:** An artistic movement focused on accurate representation.
- **Diegesis:** The narration of a story, contrasted with mimetic enactment.
- **Representation:** The broader category of signs standing for objects.

## Applications
- **Literary Criticism:** Analyzing how texts represent reality.
- **Art History:** Tracing the shift from mimetic to non-mimetic art forms.
- **Media Studies:** Examining how media constructs "reality."

## Criticism / Limitations
Modern and postmodern aesthetics have largely moved away from mimesis, arguing that art constructs reality rather than reflecting it, or that the goal of art is expression and form rather than imitation.
