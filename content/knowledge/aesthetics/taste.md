## Overview
Taste refers to the faculty of discerning quality in art, fashion, food, and culture. Historically viewed as a refined sensitivity to beauty, modern perspectives often analyze taste as a social marker and a product of cultural capital.

## Core Idea
The central tension in the concept of taste is between the "standard of taste" (the idea that some judgments are better than others) and the maxim *de gustibus non est disputandum* (there is no disputing about taste).

## Formal Definition (if applicable)
Hume defines a "standard of taste" based on the joint verdict of "true judges"—critics who possess strong sense, delicate sentiment, practice, comparison, and freedom from prejudice.

## Intuition
We often feel that our preference for a complex novel over a tabloid is not just a whim but a recognition of higher quality. However, we also recognize that our friend's preference for spicy food is simply a personal inclination. Taste bridges these two realms.

## Examples
- **High Culture:** Appreciating opera, fine wine, or abstract expressionism is often associated with "good taste."
- **Kitsch:** Objects considered to be in "bad taste" due to garishness or sentimentality.
- **Fashion:** The rapidly changing standards of what is considered tasteful in clothing.

## Common Misconceptions
- "Taste is entirely subjective." (Sociological studies show taste is heavily influenced by class and education.)
- "Good taste is innate." (It is largely acquired through exposure and education.)

## Related Concepts
- **Aesthetics:** The broader study of beauty and art.
- **Cultural Capital:** Bourdieu's concept of non-financial social assets (like education and taste) that promote social mobility.
- **Snobbery:** The attitude that one's own taste is superior to others'.

## Applications
- **Marketing:** Understanding consumer taste to target products.
- **Curating:** Selecting works for museums or galleries based on professional taste.
- **Social Analysis:** Studying how taste reinforces class boundaries.

## Criticism / Limitations
The concept of "good taste" has been criticized as a tool of exclusion, used by elites to distinguish themselves from the masses and devalue popular culture.
