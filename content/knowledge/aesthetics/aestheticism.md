## Overview
Aestheticism was a movement that flourished in Britain in the late 19th century, associated with figures like Oscar Wilde, Walter Pater, and Aubrey Beardsley. It was a reaction against the Victorian belief that art should be didactic (educational) or morally uplifting. Instead, Aesthetes believed that art had no other purpose than to be beautiful and to create a mood.

## Core Idea
The core idea is **autonomy of art**. Art exists in a separate sphere from life and morality. Its only duty is to itself. This is encapsulated in the slogan *l'art pour l'art* ("art for art's sake"). The movement also emphasized the cultivation of the self—treating one's own life as a work of art.

## Formal Definition
It is an intellectual and art movement supporting the emphasis of aesthetic values more than social-political themes for literature, fine art, music and other arts. It is often linked to **Decadence**, which celebrated artificiality and excess.

## Intuition
Think of Oscar Wilde wearing a velvet jacket and holding a lily. He is not trying to save the poor or teach you how to be a good citizen. He is trying to be a beautiful object. He famously said, "There is no such thing as a moral or an immoral book. Books are well written, or badly written. That is all."

## Examples
-   **The Picture of Dorian Gray:** Wilde's novel is both a celebration and a critique of Aestheticism. Dorian lives his life purely for sensation and beauty, hiding the ugly moral consequences in the portrait.
-   **Peacock Room:** James McNeill Whistler's room decoration is a masterpiece of Aesthetic design—blue and gold, purely decorative, with no "story" other than harmony of color.
-   **The Yellow Book:** A literary periodical associated with the movement, famous for its shocking illustrations and rejection of Victorian propriety.

## Common Misconceptions
-   **It's just being superficial:** While it values surface beauty, Aestheticism was a serious philosophical stance against the crushing utilitarianism and ugliness of the Industrial Revolution.
-   **It's immoral:** Aesthetes argued they were *amoral* (outside morality), not immoral. They believed beauty was a higher truth than conventional morality.

## Related Concepts
-   **Decadence:** A darker cousin of Aestheticism, focusing on decay, sickness, and the artificial over the natural.
-   **Dandyism:** The practice of dressing and behaving with extreme elegance and affectation. The Dandy is the hero of Aestheticism.
-   **Pre-Raphaelites:** An earlier movement that influenced Aestheticism with its focus on beauty and medievalism, though Pre-Raphaelites were often more moralistic.

## Applications
-   **Interior Design:** The "House Beautiful" movement brought Aesthetic principles into the home, emphasizing blue-and-white china, Japanese fans, and Morris wallpapers.
-   **Fashion:** The rejection of corsets in favor of loose, flowing "artistic dress" was an Aesthetic innovation.

## Criticism / Limitations
-   **Elitism:** It was a movement for the leisure class. "Art for art's sake" is a luxury that the working class, struggling for survival, could rarely afford.
-   **Disconnect from Reality:** By refusing to engage with social issues, Aestheticism can be seen as escapist and irresponsible.
