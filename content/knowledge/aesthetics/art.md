## Overview
The definition of art is one of the most debated topics in aesthetics. It encompasses a vast array of practices including painting, sculpture, literature, music, and performance, serving functions from ritual to entertainment to social critique.

## Core Idea
Art is distinguished from other human activities by its intent to communicate, express, or explore aesthetic and conceptual themes, often challenging the viewer's perception or understanding.

## Formal Definition (if applicable)
The **Institutional Theory of Art** (George Dickie) defines a work of art as an artifact upon which some person or persons acting on behalf of a certain social institution (the artworld) has conferred the status of candidate for appreciation.

## Intuition
We intuitively recognize art when we see an object or performance that seems designed not just for utility, but for contemplation, expression, or aesthetic experience.

## Examples
- **Mona Lisa:** A quintessential example of representational art.
- **Fountain (Duchamp):** A ready-made urinal presented as art, challenging traditional definitions.
- **Beethoven's 9th Symphony:** A complex musical work expressing profound emotional and intellectual themes.

## Common Misconceptions
- "Art must be beautiful." (Many modern and contemporary works aim to shock, disturb, or provoke rather than please.)
- "Art must be realistic." (Abstract and conceptual art prioritize form and idea over mimesis.)

## Related Concepts
- **Mimesis:** Representation or imitation of the real world.
- **Expressionism:** Art that seeks to convey emotional experience.
- **Aesthetics:** The study of the principles of art and beauty.

## Applications
- **Cultural Heritage:** Preserving history and identity through artistic artifacts.
- **Therapy:** Using art creation for psychological healing.
- **Social Commentary:** Using art to critique political or social systems.

## Criticism / Limitations
Defining art is notoriously difficult; essentialist definitions often fail to account for the avant-garde, while institutional definitions can seem circular or elitist.
