## Overview
Originally developed for interpreting the Bible (how do we understand God's word?), Hermeneutics expanded in the 19th and 20th centuries to become a general theory of human understanding. In aesthetics, it asks: How do we interpret a work of art? Is the meaning fixed by the artist, or does it change depending on the viewer's historical context?

## Core Idea
The core idea is the **Hermeneutic Circle**: to understand the whole (the book), you must understand the parts (the sentences); but to understand the parts, you must have a sense of the whole. Understanding is a circular, dynamic process. Furthermore, we always approach a text with **pre-understanding** (prejudices/expectations) shaped by our culture. We cannot be blank slates.

## Formal Definition
Hans-Georg Gadamer, the most important modern hermeneutic philosopher, defined understanding as a **"fusion of horizons."** The horizon of the text (its historical context) meets the horizon of the reader (our present context). Meaning is what happens in the middle. It is a dialogue, not a dissection.

## Intuition
Imagine reading *Hamlet*. A 17th-century audience saw it as a revenge tragedy. A 19th-century audience saw it as a study of melancholy. A 20th-century audience saw it through Freud (Oedipus complex). Who is right? Hermeneutics says: *Everyone*. The meaning of *Hamlet* is not a hidden diamond to be dug up; it is the history of all these interpretations. The play grows as history grows.

## Examples
-   **Legal Interpretation:** Judges use hermeneutics to interpret laws. Does the Constitution mean what the founders thought, or what we need it to mean today?
-   **Translation:** Translating a poem is a hermeneutic act. You can't just swap words; you have to interpret the *spirit* of the poem and recreate it in a new language.
-   **Art Restoration:** Deciding whether to clean a painting to look "new" or leave the "patina" of age is a hermeneutic decision about how we value the past.

## Common Misconceptions
-   **It means "anything goes":** It doesn't mean any interpretation is valid (e.g., "Hamlet is an alien"). The text offers resistance. It is a dialogue, not a monologue.
-   **It's just about books:** Hermeneutics applies to all understanding—understanding a person, a culture, or a work of art.

## Related Concepts
-   **[The Death of the Author](/knowledge/aesthetics/the-death-of-the-author/):** Hermeneutics agrees that the author's intent is not the final word, but it emphasizes the *tradition* of interpretation more than the radical freedom of the reader.
-   **Phenomenology:** The study of experience. Hermeneutics is often called "hermeneutic phenomenology" (Heidegger) because it studies the experience of understanding.
-   **Exegesis:** The practical application of interpretation (actually reading the text), whereas hermeneutics is the *theory* of how we do it.

## Applications
-   **Theology:** Still the primary home of hermeneutics (how to read sacred texts in a secular world).
-   **Humanities:** It provides the philosophical justification for the humanities (history, literature, art) as distinct from the natural sciences. We *explain* nature, but we *understand* culture.

## Criticism / Limitations
-   **Conservatism:** Critics (like Habermas) argue that Gadamer's respect for "tradition" and "authority" makes hermeneutics too conservative, unable to critique the ideologies hidden in the text.
-   **Relativism:** If meaning always changes, is there no objective truth? Hermeneutics struggles to answer this without falling into total relativism.
