## Overview
Postmodernism is a reaction against Modernism. Where Modernism sought universal truths, progress, and purity of form, Postmodernism celebrates fragmentation, ambiguity, and the mixing of styles. It argues that there is no single "Truth" or "History," but only multiple, competing narratives. In aesthetics, it marks a shift from the serious search for meaning to a playful, ironic engagement with the surfaces of culture.

## Core Idea
The core idea is **skepticism toward metanarratives**. Jean-François Lyotard defined postmodernism as "incredulity toward metanarratives"—the big stories we tell to explain the world (like "Science leads to truth" or "Communism leads to equality"). Postmodernism argues these stories are just power structures. Aesthetically, this leads to a "anything goes" approach where history is a toy box of styles to be raided.

## Formal Definition
Frederic Jameson defined postmodernism as the "cultural logic of late capitalism." He characterized it by "depthlessness" (a focus on the image/simulacrum rather than reality), the "waning of affect" (loss of deep emotion), and "pastiche" (imitation without satire).

## Intuition
Modernism is a glass skyscraper: sleek, functional, serious, rejecting the past. Postmodernism is a building that looks like a Greek temple but is made of neon and plastic, with a cartoon character on the roof. It knows it's fake, and it thinks that's funny. It mixes a classical column with a pop art sign because it doesn't believe in the hierarchy that says one is better than the other.

## Examples
-   **Architecture:** The AT&T Building (now Sony Tower) in NYC by Philip Johnson, which tops a modern skyscraper with a Chippendale furniture pediment. It breaks the rules of modernist purity.
-   **Pop Art:** Andy Warhol's soup cans blur the line between high art and commercial advertising.
-   **Literature:** *Infinite Jest* by David Foster Wallace or works by Thomas Pynchon, which feature fragmented plots, footnotes, and meta-commentary on the act of writing itself.
-   **Film:** *Pulp Fiction*, which remixes tropes from old B-movies, plays with timelines, and is hyper-aware of its own style.

## Common Misconceptions
-   **It means "anything I don't understand":** It is a specific historical and theoretical movement, not just a synonym for "weird" or "contemporary."
-   **It says "truth doesn't exist":** It says *objective, universal* truth is inaccessible or constructed by power. It doesn't deny reality, but questions our ability to represent it neutrally.

## Related Concepts
-   **Deconstruction:** A philosophical method (Derrida) often associated with postmodernism, involving taking apart texts to show their internal contradictions.
-   **Simulacra:** Jean Baudrillard's concept that we live in a world of copies without originals (e.g., Disneyland), which is central to the postmodern experience.
-   **Pastiche:** Unlike parody, which mocks, pastiche imitates a style (like a "retro" movie) with a blank irony, celebrating the style for its own sake.

## Applications
-   **Internet Culture:** The internet is the ultimate postmodern space—fragmented, non-linear, mixing high and low culture (memes), and allowing users to construct fluid identities.
-   **Urban Planning:** Postmodern urbanism (like Las Vegas) embraces the chaotic, commercial sprawl that modernists hated.
-   **Music:** Sampling in hip-hop is a quintessentially postmodern technique—recontextualizing fragments of the past to create something new.

## Criticism / Limitations
-   **Relativism:** Critics argue that if all narratives are equal, we lose the ability to make moral judgments (e.g., "If truth is constructed, how can we condemn fascism?").
-   **Nihilism:** The constant irony and detachment can lead to a sense of meaninglessness and cynicism.
-   **Obscurantism:** Postmodern theory is often criticized for being deliberately difficult and jargon-heavy (e.g., the Sokal Hoax).
