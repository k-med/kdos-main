## Overview
Design Theory is the philosophical and practical study of design. Unlike fine art, which is primarily about expression or aesthetics, design is about **problem-solving**. It bridges the gap between what something looks like (aesthetics) and how it works (function). It asks: How do we create objects that are both beautiful and useful?

## Core Idea
The central debate in design theory is the relationship between **Form** and **Function**. The modernist mantra "Form follows function" (Louis Sullivan) suggests that the shape of an object should be determined primarily by its purpose. However, design theory also recognizes that aesthetics *is* a function—emotional connection, status, and pleasure are part of why we use objects.

## Formal Definition
It encompasses the study of design methodology (how designers think), the history of design movements (Arts and Crafts, Bauhaus, Postmodernism), and the impact of design on society and the user (ergonomics, user experience).

## Intuition
Look at a standard paperclip. It is a brilliant piece of design: cheap, effective, no moving parts. Its form is perfectly adapted to its function. Now look at a Philippe Starck "Juicy Salif" lemon squeezer. It looks like an alien spaceship. It is beautiful, but it doesn't squeeze lemons very well. Design theory analyzes the trade-offs and decisions behind both objects.

## Examples
-   **The Bauhaus:** A German school (1919-1933) that revolutionized design by combining mass production with artistic vision. They championed simple, geometric forms and the unity of art and technology.
-   **Dieter Rams' 10 Principles:** A famous manifesto by the Braun designer, stating that good design is innovative, useful, aesthetic, understandable, unobtrusive, honest, long-lasting, thorough, environmentally friendly, and "as little design as possible."
-   **User-Centered Design (UCD):** A modern approach that prioritizes the needs and limitations of the end-user at every stage of the design process (e.g., designing a door handle that intuitively tells you whether to push or pull).

## Common Misconceptions
-   **Design is just "styling":** Many think design is just making things look pretty after the engineering is done. True design integrates form and function from the beginning.
-   **Good design is subjective:** While taste varies, design theory argues there are objective criteria for good design (e.g., does it work? Is it safe? Is it sustainable?).

## Related Concepts
-   **[Everyday Aesthetics](/knowledge/aesthetics/everyday-aesthetics/):** Design is the primary way aesthetics enters our daily lives.
-   **Ergonomics:** The science of designing products to fit the human body (e.g., the curve of a chair, the layout of a keyboard).
-   **Affordance:** A concept from psychology (J.J. Gibson) used in design to describe how an object suggests its use (a button affords pushing, a handle affords gripping).

## Applications
-   **Industrial Design:** Creating consumer products (cars, toasters, phones).
-   **Graphic Design:** Organizing visual information (logos, typography, websites).
-   **Service Design:** Designing intangible experiences (like the check-in process at a hotel).

## Criticism / Limitations
-   **Planned Obsolescence:** Design is often used to encourage consumption by making older products look "out of style" or break down intentionally.
-   **Universal Design vs. Exclusion:** Designing for the "average" user often excludes people with disabilities. Inclusive design seeks to remedy this.
