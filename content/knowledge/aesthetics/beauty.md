## Overview
Beauty is the quality of an object, person, or idea that provides a perceptual experience of pleasure or satisfaction. It is the foundational subject of aesthetics, bridging sensory experience with intellectual judgment.

## Core Idea
The debate over beauty centers on whether it is an objective property inherent in objects (e.g., symmetry, ratio) or a subjective response of the observer ("in the eye of the beholder").

## Formal Definition (if applicable)
While no single formal definition exists, classical definitions often rely on geometric ratios, such as the Golden Ratio ($\phi \approx 1.618$), where beauty is equated with mathematical harmony.

## Intuition
When we call a sunset or a symphony "beautiful," we are expressing a positive aesthetic judgment. This judgment feels immediate and intuitive, yet it often aligns with shared cultural or biological patterns of preference.

## Examples
- **Classical Architecture:** The Parthenon uses precise mathematical proportions to evoke a sense of balance and beauty.
- **Nature:** The symmetry of a flower or the pattern of a snowflake is often cited as natural beauty.
- **Art:** A painting that balances color and composition to create a harmonious visual experience.

## Common Misconceptions
- "Beauty is purely subjective." (While taste varies, cross-cultural studies suggest universal preferences for certain features like symmetry.)
- "Beauty is only visual." (Beauty applies to music, mathematical proofs, and moral actions as well.)

## Related Concepts
- **The Sublime:** A quality of greatness that inspires awe rather than simple pleasure.
- **Aesthetics:** The philosophical study of beauty and taste.
- **Taste:** The faculty of judging beauty.

## Applications
- **Design:** Creating products that are visually appealing to enhance user experience.
- **Art Criticism:** Analyzing why certain works evoke aesthetic responses.
- **Evolutionary Psychology:** Studying beauty as a signal of health or fitness.

## Criticism / Limitations
Focusing solely on beauty can be limiting in art, as it may exclude works that are challenging, shocking, or conceptually rigorous but not "beautiful" in the traditional sense.
