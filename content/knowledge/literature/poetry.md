## Overview
**Poetry** is a form of literature that uses aesthetic and rhythmic qualities of language—such as phonaesthetics, sound symbolism, and metre—to evoke meanings in addition to, or in place of, the prosaic ostensible meaning. It is one of the oldest forms of literary expression.

## Core Idea
The core idea of poetry is **condensed expression**. It aims to say the most with the fewest words, relying on the musicality of language and the power of imagery to bypass logical analysis and strike directly at emotion and intuition.

## Formal Definition
Poetry is a genre of literature that uses the qualities of language (rhythm, sound, imagery) to evoke emotion or convey complex ideas, often organized in lines and stanzas rather than sentences and paragraphs.

## Intuition
If prose is walking—a practical way to get from A to B—poetry is **dancing**. It is concerned not just with the destination (the meaning) but with the movement itself (the sound and rhythm).

## Examples
-   **Haiku:** A Japanese form consisting of three phrases with a 5, 7, 5 syllable structure.
-   **Sonnet:** A 14-line poem with a specific rhyme scheme and meter (usually iambic pentameter).
-   **Free Verse:** Poetry that does not rhyme or have a regular meter (e.g., Walt Whitman).

## Common Misconceptions
-   **Misconception:** Poetry must rhyme.
    -   **Correction:** Much modern and contemporary poetry is free verse and does not use rhyme. Rhythm and imagery are often more central than rhyme.
-   **Misconception:** Poetry is always obscure and difficult.
    -   **Correction:** While some poetry is dense, much of it is direct, accessible, and grounded in everyday experience.

## Related Concepts
-   **[Metaphor](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/literature/metaphor.md):** A figure of speech that describes an object or action in a way that isn't literally true but helps explain an idea or make a comparison.
-   **[Meter](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/literature/meter.md):** The basic rhythmic structure of a verse or lines in verse.
-   **[Prose](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/literature/prose.md):** Written or spoken language in its ordinary form, without metrical structure.

## Applications
-   **Emotional Expression:** A primary outlet for grief, love, and joy.
-   **Cultural Preservation:** Epics and oral poetry have preserved history and myth for millennia.
-   **Linguistic Experimentation:** Poetry pushes the boundaries of what language can do.

## Criticism and Limitations
-   **Accessibility:** High modernism and academic poetry have alienated some general readers.
-   **Translation:** Poetry is notoriously difficult to translate because it relies so heavily on the specific sounds and rhythms of the original language.
