## Overview
**Literary Criticism** is the discipline of interpreting, analyzing, and evaluating literary works. It is often informed by literary theory, which provides the philosophical and methodological framework for criticism.

## Core Idea
The core idea is that a text is not a transparent window into reality but a **construct** that can be analyzed from multiple angles—historical, psychological, linguistic, or political—to reveal deeper meanings.

## Formal Definition
Literary criticism is the reasoned discussion of literary works, an activity which may include some or all of the following procedures, in varying proportions: the defense of literature against moralists and censors, classification of a work according to its genre, analysis of its structure and style, judgment of its worth, and comparison with other works.

## Intuition
If literature is the "art," literary criticism is the "science" (or philosophy) of understanding that art. It asks *how* a book works, *why* it affects us, and *what* it says about the world.

## Examples
-   **New Criticism:** Focuses on the text itself (close reading) excluding external factors like the author's biography.
-   **Marxist Criticism:** Analyzes literature through the lens of class struggle and economic conditions.
-   **Feminist Criticism:** Examines how literature reinforces or challenges gender roles and patriarchy.

## Common Misconceptions
-   **Misconception:** Criticism is just saying whether a book is good or bad.
    -   **Correction:** While evaluation is part of it, modern criticism is more about *interpretation* and *analysis* than assigning a star rating.
-   **Misconception:** The author's intent is the only valid meaning.
    -   **Correction:** The "Intentional Fallacy" suggests that the text often contains meanings the author did not consciously intend, and the reader's interpretation is equally valid.

## Applications

-   **Cultural Analysis:** Using literature to diagnose the health and values of a culture.
-   **Enrichment:** Helping readers find deeper layers of meaning in what they read.

## Criticism and Limitations
-   **Over-theorizing:** Critics are sometimes accused of imposing theories onto texts that don't fit, or using jargon that obscures rather than illuminates.
-   **Subjectivity:** Despite attempts at rigor, criticism remains highly subjective.
