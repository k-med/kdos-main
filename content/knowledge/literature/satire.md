## Overview
**Satire** is a genre of literature (and graphic arts, performing arts, etc.) in which vices, follies, abuses, and shortcomings are held up to ridicule, ideally with the intent of shaming individuals, corporations, government, or society itself into improvement.

## Core Idea
The core idea of satire is **constructive mockery**. It uses laughter as a weapon to attack something the author considers bad or foolish. It is not just being mean; it has a moral purpose.

## Formal Definition
Satire is the use of humor, irony, exaggeration, or ridicule to expose and criticize people's stupidity or vices, particularly in the context of contemporary politics and other topical issues.

## Intuition
Satire is a **funhouse mirror**. It distorts reality to show us the ugly truth. By exaggerating a flaw, it makes it impossible to ignore.

## Examples
-   **"A Modest Proposal" by Jonathan Swift:** Suggests that the poor Irish should sell their children as food to the rich—a savage critique of British policy and heartlessness.
-   **"Animal Farm" by George Orwell:** A beast fable satirizing the Russian Revolution and the corruption of power.
-   **"Catch-22" by Joseph Heller:** Satirizes the absurdity of war and bureaucracy.

## Common Misconceptions
-   **Misconception:** Satire is just comedy.
    -   **Correction:** Comedy seeks to entertain; satire seeks to correct. Satire can be funny, but it can also be angry, bitter, or horrifying.
-   **Misconception:** Parody and satire are the same.
    -   **Correction:** Parody mimics a style for comic effect (e.g., *Scary Movie*). Satire uses mimicry to criticize the subject (e.g., *The Great Dictator*).

## Related Concepts
-   **[Irony](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/literature/irony.md):** The expression of one's meaning by using language that normally signifies the opposite.
-   **[Parody](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/literature/parody.md):** An imitation of the style of a particular writer, artist, or genre with deliberate exaggeration for comic effect.
-   **[Allegory](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/literature/allegory.md):** A story, poem, or picture that can be interpreted to reveal a hidden meaning, typically a moral or political one.

## Applications
-   **Political Activism:** A powerful tool for dissent in repressive regimes (where direct criticism is dangerous).
-   **Social Reform:** Has historically helped change public opinion on issues like slavery, war, and corruption.

## Criticism and Limitations
-   **Misinterpretation:** Satire is often misunderstood by those who take it literally (Poe's Law).
-   **Preaching to the Choir:** Often only appreciated by those who already agree with the author's viewpoint.
