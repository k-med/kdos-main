## Overview
**Modernism** was a radical break with the past in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. In literature, it responded to the horrors of World War I and the rapid industrialization of society by rejecting traditional narrative forms and embracing fragmentation, stream of consciousness, and ambiguity.

## Core Idea
The core idea of Modernism is **"Make it new"** (Ezra Pound). Modernists believed that the old ways of storytelling (linear plots, omniscient narrators) could no longer capture the fractured, chaotic reality of the modern world.

## Formal Definition
Modernism is a philosophical and art movement that arose from broad transformations in Western society during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. In literature, it is characterized by a self-conscious break with traditional styles of poetry and verse.

## Intuition
Imagine a mirror that has been shattered. Traditional realism tries to glue the pieces back together to show a coherent reflection. Modernism leaves the pieces on the floor and asks you to look at the reflection in each shard, acknowledging that a unified view of the world is no longer possible.

## Examples
-   **"Ulysses" by James Joyce:** Uses stream of consciousness to depict a single day in Dublin, paralleling the Odyssey.
-   **"The Waste Land" by T.S. Eliot:** A fragmented, allusive poem capturing the disillusionment of the post-war generation.
-   **"To the Lighthouse" by Virginia Woolf:** Explores the subjectivity of time and the interior lives of characters.

## Common Misconceptions
-   **Misconception:** Modernism is just "weird for the sake of being weird."
    -   **Correction:** The difficulty of Modernist texts is a deliberate attempt to mirror the complexity and difficulty of modern consciousness.
-   **Misconception:** Modernism is the same as Contemporary.
    -   **Correction:** Modernism refers to a specific historical period (roughly 1900-1950). We are now in a Post-Modern or Metamodern era.

## Related Concepts
-   **[Stream of Consciousness](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/literature/stream-of-consciousness.md):** A narrative mode or method that attempts "to depict the multitudinous thoughts and feelings which pass through the mind" of a narrator.
-   **[Postmodernism](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/literature/postmodernism.md):** A late-20th-century movement that extended and critiqued Modernism, often embracing irony and pop culture.
-   **[Avant-Garde](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/aesthetics/avant-garde.md):** People or works that are experimental, radical, or unorthodox with respect to art, culture, or society.

## Applications
-   **Artistic Innovation:** Paved the way for almost all subsequent experimental art.
-   **Psychological Realism:** Deepened the ability of literature to represent the human mind.

## Criticism and Limitations
-   **Elitism:** Modernist works can be notoriously difficult and inaccessible to the average reader, often requiring extensive education to decode.
-   **Nihilism:** Often criticized for its bleak, fragmented view of human existence.
