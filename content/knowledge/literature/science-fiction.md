## Overview
**Science Fiction** (Sci-Fi) is a genre of speculative fiction that deals with imaginative and futuristic concepts such as advanced science and technology, space exploration, time travel, parallel universes, and extraterrestrial life. It has been called the "literature of ideas."

## Core Idea
The core idea is **"What if?"** Sci-fi takes a current trend (technological, social, or scientific) and extrapolates it into the future or an alternate reality to explore its consequences.

## Formal Definition
Science fiction is a genre of fiction dealing with imaginative content such as future settings, futuristic science and technology, space travel, time travel, faster than light travel, parallel universes, and extraterrestrial life. It usually explores the potential consequences of scientific, social, and technological innovations.

## Intuition
Sci-fi is a **laboratory for the mind**. It allows us to run simulations of different societies and technologies to see what might happen before we actually get there.

## Examples
-   **"Dune" by Frank Herbert:** Explores ecology, religion, and politics on a desert planet.
-   **"Neuromancer" by William Gibson:** Pioneered the cyberpunk genre and the concept of cyberspace.
-   **"The Left Hand of Darkness" by Ursula K. Le Guin:** A thought experiment about a society without fixed gender.

## Common Misconceptions
-   **Misconception:** It's just about spaceships and lasers.
    -   **Correction:** "Soft" sci-fi focuses on psychology, sociology, and politics (e.g., "The Handmaid's Tale") rather than hardware.
-   **Misconception:** It predicts the future.
    -   **Correction:** Its goal is rarely accurate prediction, but rather *commentary* on the present.

## Related Concepts
-   **[Fantasy](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/literature/fantasy.md):** A genre that uses magic and other supernatural forms as a primary element of plot, theme, and/or setting.
-   **[Dystopia](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/literature/dystopia.md):** An imagined community or society that is dehumanizing and frightening.
-   **[Cyberpunk](file:///home/kdos/Anvil/kdos-main/content/knowledge/literature/cyberpunk.md):** A subgenre of science fiction in a futuristic setting that tends to focus on a "combination of lowlife and high tech".

## Applications
-   **Technological Inspiration:** Many real inventions (cell phones, submarines) were inspired by sci-fi.
-   **Ethics:** A vital space for debating the ethics of AI, cloning, and surveillance.

## Criticism and Limitations
-   **Escapism:** Can be dismissed as mere entertainment without literary merit (though this view is fading).
-   **Obsolescence:** Sci-fi stories can age poorly as the "future" they predict arrives and looks different.
